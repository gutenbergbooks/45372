<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<p>In offering these pages to the public, my object has
been confined to imparting such advice, in matters
connected with <i>coaching</i>, as has been suggested by
long experience; whilst, in order to dissipate as much
as possible the &ldquo;dryness&rdquo; of being told &ldquo;what to do&rdquo;
and &ldquo;how to do it,&rdquo; I have mingled the instruction
with illustrative anecdotes and incidents, which may
afford amusement to the general reader. If whilst my
bars are &ldquo;whistling&rdquo; up the hill, and rattling down,
I have been able to combine some useful hints with
the amusement often to be discovered in what I have
termed &ldquo;Scrapings of the Road,&rdquo; my desire will be
amply gratified.</p>

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="uc"><span class="hide">T</span>o</span> their honour be it said, that there
are noblemen and gentlemen in the
land, who willingly devote time,
energy, and money, to keep the dust flying
from the wheels of the real old stage coach.
The importance of driving well, and the pleasure
derivable therefrom, are both enhanced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
moral duty and responsibility involved in directing
a public conveyance. The journey once
advertised forms a contract which is most
religiously observed, and the punctuality and
precision noticeable in the coaches of the revival
are among their most commendable features.</p>

<p>This is fortunate&mdash;since elderly critics may
still be seen, grouped around the door of the
White Horse Cellars, prepared to institute invidious
comparisons, and difficult to be won over
to believe in anything but &ldquo;the old times,&rdquo;
when Sir Vincent Cotton and Brackenbury
worked the &ldquo;Brighton Age,&rdquo; when Lord Edward
Thynne piloted the &ldquo;Portsmouth Rocket,&rdquo; when
&ldquo;Gentleman Dean&rdquo; waggoned the Bath mail,
and a hundred minor celebrities glistened in
the coaching sphere. Although the interval
between these old coaching days and the revival
was a long one, the connecting-link was never
entirely broken. The &ldquo;how to do it&rdquo; has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
handed down by some of the most brilliant
coachmen of the age, gentle and simple, who,
although the obituary shows their ranks to
have been grievously thinned, are still warm
supporters of the revival, and who, by their
example and practice, have restored in an amateur
form a system of coaching which is quite equal
(if not a little superior) to anything in the
olden times. Where so many excel it would be
invidious to particularise, but I have seen the
&ldquo;Oxford,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Portsmouth,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Guildford,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Brighton,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Windsor,&rdquo; &ldquo;St. Albans,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Box Hill,&rdquo; as well as sundry other short coaches,
leave the White Horse Cellars as perfectly
appointed in every particular as anything the
old coaching days could supply. Coaching in
England had well-nigh died a natural death&mdash;ay,
and, what is worse, been buried! Poor
&ldquo;Old Clarke&rdquo; (supported by a noble duke,
the staunchest patron of the road) fanned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
last expiring spark with the &ldquo;Brighton Age,&rdquo;
until his health broke down and he succumbed.
Another coach started against him on the
opposite days by Kingston and Ewell, called
the &ldquo;Recherché&rdquo; (a private venture), but it did
not last even so long as the &ldquo;Age.&rdquo; Here
was the interval! The end of everything.</p>

<p>In 1868 a coach was started to Brighton called
the &ldquo;Old Times,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the property of a company
composed of all the <i>élite</i> of the coaching talent of
the day. It proved a great success, and became
very popular; especially, it may be added, among
its own shareholders, who, being all coachmen, in
turn aspired to the box&mdash;those who could, as well
as those who only fancied they could. The
initiated will at once understand how fatal this
was to the comfort of every fresh team which
came under their lash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the coaching season (October
30th, 1868) the stock was sold, and realised two-thirds
more than had been invested in it. The
goodwill and a large portion of the stock
were purchased by Chandos Pole, who was afterwards
joined by the Duke of Beaufort and
&ldquo;Cherry Angel,&rdquo; and these gentlemen carried on
the coach for three years.</p>

<p>The second coach started in the revival was
one to Beckenham and Bromley, horsed and
driven by Charles Hoare, who afterwards extended
it to Tunbridge Wells. It was very well
appointed, and justly popular. The ball once
set rolling, coaching quickly became a mania.
The railings of the White Horse Cellars were
placarded with boards and handbills of all colours
and dimensions: &ldquo;A well-appointed four-horse
coach will leave Hatchett&rsquo;s Hotel on such and
such days, for nearly every provincial town
within fifty miles of London.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>From the 1st May to the 1st September
the pavement opposite to the coach-office was
crowded by all the &ldquo;hossy&rdquo; gentlemen of the
period. Guards and professionals might be seen
busy with the coach-ladders, arranging their
passengers, especially attentive to those attired
in muslin, who seemed to require as much
coupling and pairing as pigeons in a dovecot.
Knots of gentlemen discussed the merits of this
or that wheeler or leader, till, reminded by the
White Horse clock that time was up, they took
a cursory glance at their way-bills, and, mounting
their boxes, stole away to the accompaniment
of &ldquo;a yard of tin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A well-loaded coach with a level team
properly handled, is an object which inspires
even the passing crowd with a thrill of
pleasurable approbation, if not a tiny atom of
envy. Whyte Melville contended that a lady
could never look so well as in a riding-habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and properly mounted. Other authorities incline
to the fact that the exhilarating effect produced
by riding upon a drag, coupled with the
opportunity of social conversation and repartee,
enhances, if possible, the charms of female
attractiveness. Be this as it may, when the end
of a journey is reached, the universal regret of
the lady passengers is, not that the coachman
has driven too quickly, but that the journey
is not twice as long as it is. Interesting as
the animated scene in Piccadilly during the
summer months may be to those who have a
taste for the road, there is another treat in
store for the coaching man, afforded by a meet
of the drags at the Magazine during the London
season on special days, of which notice is
given. We do not stop to inquire if the coach
was built in Oxford Street, Park Street, Piccadilly,
or Long Acre; whether the harness was
made by Merry or Gibson; whether the team had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
cost a thousand guineas or two hundred pounds,
but we say that the display of the whole
stands unequalled and unrivalled by the rest
of the world. This unbounded admiration and
approval do not at all deteriorate from the merits
of the well-appointed four-horse coaches leaving
Piccadilly every morning (Sundays excepted), as
there is as much difference between a stage-coach
and a four-in-hand as there is between a mirror
and a mopstick.</p>

<p>Horses for a road-coach should have sufficient
breeding to insure that courage and endurance
which enable them to travel with ease to themselves
at the pace required, and if they are
all of one class, or, as old Jack Peer used to
say, &ldquo;all of a mind,&rdquo; the work is reduced to
a minimum. Whereas, horses for the parade
at the Magazine must stand sixteen hands;
and, when bitted and beared up, should not
see the ground they stand upon. They must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
have action enough to kill them in a twelve-mile
stage with a coach, even without a
Shooter&rsquo;s Hill in it.</p>

<p>I do not say this in any spirit of disparagement
of the magnificent animals provided by
the London dealers at the prices which such
animals ought to command.</p>

<p>I may here remind my patient reader that
unless the greatest care and vigilance is exercised
in driving these Magazine teams, it is three
to one in favour of one horse, one showy
impetuous favourite, doing all the work, whilst
the other three are running behind their collars,
because they dare not face their bits. It&rsquo;s a
caution to a young coachman, and spoils all
the pleasure of the drive. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a good match
in size, colour, and action, but he pulls me
off the box; I&rsquo;ve tried a tight curb and nose-band,
a high port, a gag, all in vain! If I
keep him and he must pull, let him pull the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
coach instead of my fingers; run a side-rein
through his own harness-terret to his partner&rsquo;s tug.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No amount of driving power or resin will
prevent one &ldquo;borer&rdquo; from pulling the reins
through your fingers. I hereby utterly condemn
the use of anything of the sort. If your reins
are new, they can be educated in the harness-room;
but the rendering them sticky with
composition entirely prevents the driver from
exercising the &ldquo;give and take&rdquo; with the mouths
of his team which is the key to good coachmanship.
Let the back of the left hand be
turned well down, the fingers erect; let the
whip-hand act occasionally as a pedal does to
a pianoforte, and, rely upon it, you are better
without resin.</p>

<p>Whyte Melville, in his interesting work,
&ldquo;Riding Recollections,&rdquo; recites an anecdote,
which I may be forgiven for quoting, as it
combines both theory and instruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A celebrated Mr. Maxse, celebrated some
fifteen years ago for a fineness of hand that
enabled him to cross Leicestershire with fewer
falls than any other sportsman of fifteen stone
who rode equally straight, used to display much
comical impatience with the insensibility of his
servants to this useful quality. He was once
seen explaining to his coachman, with a silk
handkerchief passed round a post. &lsquo;Pull at it,&rsquo;
says the master. &lsquo;Does it pull at you?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; answered the servant, grinning.
&lsquo;Slack it off then. Does it pull at you now?&rsquo;
&lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well then, you double-distilled
fool, can&rsquo;t you see that your horses are like
that post? If you don&rsquo;t pull at <i>them</i>, they
won&rsquo;t pull at <i>you</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A team, if carelessly driven for a few
journeys, will soon forget their good manners,
and begin to lean and bore upon a coachman&rsquo;s
hands; and when the weight of one horse&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
head (if he declines to carry it himself) is considered
and multiplied by four, it will readily
be believed that a coachman driving fifty or
sixty miles daily will make it his study to
reduce his own labour by getting his horses to
go pleasantly and cheerfully together.</p>

<p>There are, of course, instances which defy
all the science which can be brought to bear.
Horses do not come to a coach because they
are found too virtuous for other employment,
and the fact of their being engaged with a
blank character, or, at most, &ldquo;has been in
harness,&rdquo; does not inform the purchaser that
they made firewood of the trap in their last
situation.</p>

<p>I do not intend this remark to be defamatory
of the whole of the horses working in the
coaches of the revival. The average prices
obtained at the sales at the end of the season
prove the contrary. Many horses working in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the coaches of the present day have occupied
very creditable places in the hunting-field, and,
should they return thither, will be found none
the worse for having been summered in a stage-coach.</p>

<p>Indeed, I am of opinion that this method
of summering has considerable advantages over
the system so often adopted, of first inflicting
the greatest pain and punishment upon the
animal by blistering all round, whether he requires
it or not, and then sentencing him to five months&rsquo;
solitary confinement in a melancholy box or very
limited yard.</p>

<p>In the first case, a horse doing a comparatively
short stage, provided he is carefully driven, is
always amused. His muscles and sinews are kept
in action without being distressed, his diet is
generous and sufficient without being inflammatory,
and, though last not least, he is a constant source
of pleasurable satisfaction to his owner, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
as a means of bringing him to the notice of many
sporting admirers, who may materially help the
average in the autumn sale.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that horses, as a rule, enjoy
coaching work, and many become good disciples
to a ten-mile stage which could not be persuaded
to do a stroke of work of any other description.</p>

<p>There are many exceptions to this rule. I
have found in my own experience that, when
hurriedly getting together twenty or thirty horses
for coaching purposes, I have been fascinated by
symmetry, and perhaps by small figures, and have
bought an unprofitable horse. A visit to St.
Martin&rsquo;s Lane, under such circumstances, once
made me possessor of the very prettiest animal
I almost ever saw&mdash;a red chestnut mare, a broad
front, two full intelligent eyes, with a head which
would have gone easily into a pint pot, ears well
set on, a long lean neck, joining to such withers
and shoulders as would have shamed a Derby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
winner, legs and feet which defied unfavourable
criticism. Here was a catch! And all this for
eighteen guineas! Nothing said, nothing written;
her face was her fortune, and I thought, mine too.
She&rsquo;s too good for the coach; she ought to ride,
to carry a lady; appears a perfect lamb. I could
not resist what appeared to me an opportunity
which everybody except myself seemed to neglect;
I bowed to the gentleman in the box, who immediately
dropped his hammer, saying: &ldquo;For
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I overheard some remarks from the spectators
which did not confirm my satisfaction at having
invested in an animal without any character.
&ldquo;She knows her way here by herself;&rdquo; &ldquo;She
won&rsquo;t have leather at any price,&rdquo; whispered another
coper; but, as all evil reports are resorted to by
the craft on such occasions, I did not heed
them.</p>

<p>I soon found out that my new purchase was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
not precisely a lamb. To mount her was impossible.
She reared, bucked, kicked, plunged,
and finally threw herself down; so that part of
the business I gave up. I then began to put
harness upon her. To this she submitted cheerfully,
and, when she had stood in it for two
days, I gammoned her into her place in the
break, when, having planted herself, she declined
to move one inch. The schoolmaster (break-horse)
exercised all the patience and encouragement
which such equine instructors know so
well how to administer. He started the load,
pulling very gently. He pulled a little across
her, he backed a few inches, then leaned suddenly
from her. All this being to no purpose, he tried
coercion, and dragged her on, upon which, turning
the whites of her innocent eyes up, she made
one plunge and flung herself down.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster looked at her reproachfully,
but stood still as a mouse, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
her whole weight being upon his pole-chain,
till she was freed.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/i_027-large.jpg"><img src="images/i_027.jpg" width="600" height="332" alt="AN UNEXPECTED GUEST." /></a>
</div>

<p>She was too handsome to fight about on
the stones, so I determined to try another
dodge; and, putting a pair of wheelers behind
her, and giving her a good free partner, I put
her before the bars (near-side lead). Here the
cross of the lamb in her was predominant, she
went away, showing all the gentleness without
even the skipping.</p>

<p>I took her immediately into the crowded
streets, a system I have always found most
successful with those horses which require distraction,
and her behaviour was perfect. I was
so well satisfied, that without further trial I
sent her down the road to make one of a
team from Sutton to Reigate, where she worked
steadily, and remained an excellent leader for
one week, when it seemed as if a sudden inspiration
reminded her that the monotony of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the work, as well as the bars of the coach,
should be broken by some flight of fancy. She
made one tremendous jump into the air, as
high as a swallow ordinarily flies in fine
weather&mdash;which evolution cost me &ldquo;a bar,&rdquo;
and after a few consecutive buck-jumps went
quietly away. She did not confine her romps,
however, to this comparatively harmless frolic,
but contrived to land from these wonderful
jumps among groups of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects
where she was least expected.</p>

<p>On one occasion I was coming away from
a change at D&mdash;&mdash;d, when, at the signal to
go, she jumped from the middle of the road
completely through the bay-window of a tailor&rsquo;s
shop, where several men were occupied on the
board. At another time she was put to at
S&mdash;&mdash;n, where, the weather being oppressively
hot, a party of yokels were regaling <i>al fresco</i>
round a large table under the trees. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
attention was naturally attracted to the coach
during the change of horses, but little did they
dream that in another minute one of the leaders
would be on the table before them. So, however,
it was. With one bound, scattering the
pipes and pewters far and wide, she landed in
the middle of the board.</p>

<p>I should have delighted in continuing my
attempts to subdue the temper of this beautiful
animal, especially as, once off, she made a
superlatively good leader; but, where the public
safety was jeopardised, I did not feel justified
in further argument with the young lady, and
therefore sold her to a stud company on the
Continent.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="drop"><img src="images/drop_t.png" width="80" height="79" alt="T" /></div>
<p class="afterdrop"><span class="uc"><span class="hide">T</span>o</span> a man who has a taste for driving,
what can be more fascinating than
to find himself upon the box of his
own drag, with four three-parts-bred, well-matched
horses before him, of which he is master? But
how is this supreme pleasure to be arrived
at? He may give fabulous prices for his horses,
his coach and appointments may be faultless,
all selected with great judgment, and still
there will be moments when aching arms,
paralysed fingers, and animals who seem determined
to go &ldquo;no how,&rdquo; will compel him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
wish himself in any other position. In order
to guard against this, I would enjoin a young
beginner not to run away with the idea that
because he has driven four horses without getting
into trouble, or, as still more frequently occurs,
because he can drive a tandem, he can be in any
degree a match for a team of horses with spirit
and mettle, unless he have first carefully mastered
the rudiments of the ribbons. There are many
self-taught men who are excellent coachmen, and
who, from long habit and experience, may be as
much at home, in cases of sudden difficulty, as some
of the more educated; but they invariably lack a
certain precautionary system which makes almost
any team go well and comfortably, and reduces
the chance of an accident to a minimum. There
are, alas, very few preceptors of the old school, but
why the present generation should not be as
well able to instruct themselves as were the men
of fifty years ago is to me an unexplained marvel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite true that when coaching was a
most important business, and when the component
parties&mdash;contractors, coachmen, horsekeepers,
and horses&mdash;sprang into existence,
apparently for the purpose of carrying it on,
there was a professional caste about the whole
affair which kept it distinct and separate from
all others. A proprietor was a big man, and
his importance was measured by the ground he
covered. There was an emulative rivalry between
these gentlemen, which reflected very healthily
upon the style in which their coaches were
done.</p>

<p>The contractor supplied such horses as the
proprietor required to cover the ground at a
given coaching price.</p>

<p>The coachman had to keep such time as was
laid down by the rules of the coach, and this
was a point upon which depended much of the
merit of the man. A coachman who, from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
intimate knowledge of his ground, knew when
to bustle and where to save his horses, was an
invaluable acquisition to his employer. Horses
themselves will sometimes suggest a little judicious
springing, by which some of the most trying
hills are more easily negotiated; but there is
nothing better than to keep an even pace
throughout the stage, jogging up all hills, easing
them at the top, and coming steady off the
crown of a descent. If circumstances should arise
by which the time has been stolen from the
horses, let me enjoin you, in the name of the
whole equine race, not to attempt to make it
up by showing your expertness with the whip
up the hills; this is downright cruelty; and,
in nine cases out of ten, the extra exertion and
nervous efforts to respond are all made by one
horse more sensitive than the rest of the team.
It is better to wait for time than to race after
it, the latter invariably resulting in one horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
being so much more baked than the others as
to cause the knowing eyes around the White
Horse Cellars to wink when you do arrive.</p>

<p>To make my reader comfortable with his
team as quickly as possible, I would here offer
a few hints, which I venture to think will be
found valuable to all not too proud to learn.</p>

<p>Being, then, comfortably attired, taking care
that no part of his clothing approaches to tightness,
supplied with a good thick shoe and gaiter,
an easy (very easy) dogskin glove, taking care
that the fingers are not too long (he should
always be provided with a pair of woollen
gloves in case of wet weather), we may safely
leave supplementary garments to his own taste.</p>

<p>Having looked round his horses&mdash;a proceeding
which no coachman should neglect&mdash;he
walks up to the flank of the off-wheeler and
takes <i>all</i> his reins, which should have been
doubled and tucked into the tug on the off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>-side.
Stepping back a pace, he separates his
leading-reins, and pulls them through the terrets
till he has gathered up the slack. He then slips
his wheel-reins on either side of his right hand
middle-finger, the near-side leading-rein over
the forefinger, and the other over the wheel-rein
between the fore and middle fingers of his
right hand.</p>

<p>If he changes his whip it will be laid across
the cruppers of the wheelers, and must be taken
up, caught, and placed in the same hand with
the reins, so as to leave the left free to seize the
step of the front-boot, when, by stepping on the
fore-wheel, and throwing the weight of his body
well before it, the walk up on the bench will
be comparatively easy and graceful. Having
arrived there, still keeping the whip and reins
in the right hand, he quickly settles his seat
and apron, then shifting his reins to his left
hand, in the same order which they occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in the right, he proceeds to shorten them till
he just feels the mouths of his horses.</p>

<p>The beauty and grace of a driving-seat is to
assume such a posture as does not admit of any
constraint. Without freedom of the wrist and
arm, the whip, instead of being a most interesting
plaything, will be a constant source of annoyance
and difficulty to a young coachman. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
catch.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Always because he will
not let the bow of the thong swing sufficiently
away from him, but tries it with a stiff arm.
When once the knack is acquired it will last a
lifetime, and there is no instrument the proper
handling of which gives such a finish and proficiency,
as a well-poised &ldquo;yew&rdquo; or a properly-weighted
&ldquo;holly.&rdquo; Often have I been obliged
to give away old favourite &ldquo;crops&rdquo; because mine
would &ldquo;catch&rdquo; and others would not.</p>

<p>A good coachman shows his proficiency as
well by the manner of his getting up on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
bench as by the necessary preliminaries to make
a comfortable start after he is seated. A lady,
who must have been a close observer, once remarked
to me that a certain gentleman, who was
a mutual acquaintance, must be a very careful
coachman, for, when riding upon the box-seat
with him, he constantly asked her to hold the
whip for him, while he went through a process
of what appeared to her like &ldquo;plaiting the reins.&rdquo;
There is a right way and a wrong way, and, at
the risk of being a trifle wearisome, I venture to
introduce a few hints for the benefit of such of
my young readers as may desire to be guided in
the acquirements of an art at once useful and
agreeable, by tracing some of the oldest habits
of the profession, and thus, in coaching parlance,
picking up some of the &ldquo;dodges of the road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us attempt to follow a professional
&ldquo;Jehu&rdquo; over a stage or two of his ground.</p>

<p>His coach loaded and passengers placed, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
takes a careful look round to see that every
part of his harness is in its place and properly
adjusted, and, if reminded by seeing any particular
horse that he had gone uncomfortably on
his last journey, to endeavour to find out the
cause and have it altered. I have known a
horse, usually straight and pleasant in his work,
all at once take to snatching the rein and run
away wide of his partner, and this occasioned
only by the winker-strap being too short, causing
the winker to press against his frontal-bone,
the apparently trifling irregularity causing so
much pain as to drive him almost mad.</p>

<p>A wheeler sometimes takes to <i>diving</i> suddenly
with his head, and almost snatching the
rein out of the driver&rsquo;s hand. This can only
be prevented by putting a bearing-rein upon
him; and though this has often been censured
(on the road), it has as often been condoned at
the end of the stage. His inspection made, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
mounts his box, according to the foregoing rules,
and having given some parting instructions to
his horsekeeper&mdash;&ldquo;Send &lsquo;Old Giles&rsquo; down o&rsquo; the
off-side to-morrow, and rest the &lsquo;Betsy Mare,&rsquo;
etc. etc.&rdquo;&mdash;the office to start is given; when the
lightest feel of their mouths (wheelers having
a little the most room) and a &ldquo;klick&rdquo; ought
to be enough to start them.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Nothing is such
&ldquo;bad form&rdquo; as to start with the whip; in dismissing
which latter article I would caution
young coachmen against the practice of carrying
it in the socket. The moment when it may be
required cannot be foreseen.</p>

<p>A well-organised team soon settles, and
though for a mile or two they may appear to
pull uncomfortably and not divide the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
evenly, this is often occasioned merely by freshness
and impatience, when presently they will
settle down and go like &ldquo;oil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A young friend, who lived not one hundred
miles from Queen&rsquo;s Gate, once asked me to
come and see a splendid team he had purchased.
I was indeed struck by their appearance when
they came to the door. All roans, sixteen-and-a-half
hands, very well bred, decorated
all over with crest and coronet. There was a
small party for the drag, with, of course, some
muslin on the box, and I took my place behind
the driver. I very soon observed that, although
they were very highly bitted, they were carrying
too many guns for our coachman; and we had
not proceeded far when I ventured to remark
that he was going rather fast (at this moment
three were cantering), and in reply my friend
candidly declared &ldquo;he could not hold them.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Then pull them all up at once,&rdquo; I said promptly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
&ldquo;or they&rsquo;ll be away with you.&rdquo; Failing in this
he accepted an offer of assistance, and, taking
the reins, I, not without difficulty, stopped the
runaways, and effected several alterations in their
couplings, bittings, and harness.</p>

<p>I expected my friend would have resumed
his post, but his hand was so paralysed that
he could not grasp the reins. The explanation
of this episode is twofold&mdash;firstly, the team was
improperly put together; secondly, my friend
discovered when we got to Richmond that he
had been attempting to drive in a tight wrist-band,
which, next to a tight glove, is of all
things to be avoided. We had had unquestionably
a narrow escape from what might have
been a very serious accident. When four high-couraged
horses, all very green and not properly
strung together, get off &ldquo;the balance&rdquo; with a
weak coachman, it is time to look out for a
soft place. After I had made this team more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
comfortable in their harness, and their mouths
more easily reached by the coupling-reins, they
became, in my hands, perfectly temperate and
docile, and gave every promise of becoming a
handy pleasant lot.</p>

<p>It is a dangerous thing for a young coachman
to embark with a team without somebody
with him who can relieve his paralysed fingers
and wrists if occasion requires; and this danger
is increased tenfold if the team is composed of
high-mettled cattle unused to their work or their
places. I have found it very useful to condition
the muscles of the arm by dumb-belling or
balancing a chair upon the middle-finger of the
left hand with the arm extended.</p>

<p>I trust that the foregoing hints may not
be received with disdain. How many men there
are who, from mistaken self-sufficiency, go through
a whole life in practising what must be very
uncomfortable, merely because they have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
too proud to learn the A B C of the business.
Without confidence&mdash;I may almost say without
courage&mdash;no man can enjoy driving &ldquo;a team.&rdquo;
He will be in a constant state of fret and
in apprehension of all sorts of imaginary eventualities.
The misgiving that they are either
going too fast or not fast enough, not working
straight, won&rsquo;t stop the coach down hill, and a
thousand other qualms, might all have been
prevented by spending a few pounds at The
Paxton.</p>

was through the arms and legs
of a wooden semaphore, and the only
means of public locomotion the public highroad,
competition for public favour carried opposition
to the highest pitch, and the pace acquired by
some of the fast coaches was extraordinary. When
ten or fifteen minutes could be scored over the
arrival of the opposition&mdash;if the &ldquo;Telegraph&rdquo; could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>

was a subject of anxious comment until this state of
things was reversed. Notwithstanding this, no class
of men lived on better terms with each other than
stage-coachmen off the bench. They were a class of
men peculiar to themselves. The very fact of the
trust reposed in them invested them with a superiority.
Many coachmen in those days were educated
men and had occupied higher positions in life; but
in cases where the taste existed, and the talent could
be acquired, although the work was extremely hard&mdash;exposure
to every change of weather, the unflagging
strain upon the attention, the grave
responsibility incurred by the charge of so many
lives&mdash;there was something so fascinating in the
work, that there were few instances of their relinquishing
the ribbons except from physical
incapacity. This love of the business followed
them through life&mdash;and even after death&mdash;as
exemplified by the following anecdote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>An old coachman, who had driven the Norwich
mail for thirty years of his life, became at last
superannuated, and retired to his native village
and repose. But to the last day of his life he
prepared himself at the accustomed hour to take
his usual seat, being at great pains to adjust his
shawl and pull on his driving-gloves, then, taking
his coat upon his arm and his whip in his hand,
he would shuffle down the little gravel path to the
garden-gate, to await the passing of the mail. He
died at the good old age of eighty-six years; but
not before he had expressed his desire to be buried
at the corner of the churchyard abutting upon the
highroad, in order that &ldquo;he might hear the coach
go by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another instance of the fascination of coach-driving
is to be found in the case of &ldquo;Old John,&rdquo;
who drove a pair-horse coach from Exeter to
Teignmouth and back daily, a distance of forty
miles, for a period of eighteen years, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
missing a single day. At last, being half-teazed,
half-joked by his fellow-whips into taking a
holiday, he reluctantly consented to do so. Being
much at a loss how to spend &ldquo;a happy day,&rdquo; and
enjoy his leisure to the full, he at length decided
upon going to the coach-office and booking himself
as a passenger on the opposition coach to Teignmouth
and back. &ldquo;Old John&rdquo; (as he was called)
never drove with lamps but once, and then he
upset his coach. He always buckled his reins to
the iron rail of the box before starting.</p>

<p>The guards of the old mails were always provided
with spare gear in case of accidents, as well
as a tool-chest; and&mdash;though last not least&mdash;an
armoury consisting of one bell-mouthed blunderbuss&mdash;a
formidable weapon, which, for an all-round shot
would have been as effective as a mitrailleuse, both
amongst friends and enemies&mdash;two large horse-pistols
(ammunition to match), and a short dirky-looking
sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>There were many instances of the mails being
robbed and plundered upon the road; but the
success was more attributable to intrigue and
stratagem than to personal daring and courage.</p>

<p>The plan was this. An impediment is placed
in the road by lacing cords across the track. The
mail comes to a stop; the horses are in confusion;
the guard steps down to render assistance, when
one of the highwaymen immediately jumps up and
secures the arms, and probably the bags, which
were carried under the feet of the guard. Any
attempt at resistance on the part of the guard is
met by threats with his own arms. The coachman
being rendered powerless by the traces having been
cut, in many instances (the day having been carefully
selected as one of those on which the bankers&rsquo;
parcel travelled) mail and cargo fell a rich and
easy prey to the robbers.</p>

<p>Apart from the mails being selected by highwaymen
as victims of plunder, they were frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
used as co-operative vehicles in their iniquitous
traffic.</p>

<p>On one occasion when the way-bill of the Dover
mail bore the name of Miss &mdash;&mdash;, two inside places
had been booked three weeks in advance. At the
hour of leaving the coach-office, two trunks covered
and sewn up in the whitest linen, two dressing-cases,
two carpet-bags, besides the smaller articles,
baskets, reticules, wrappers, etc., had been duly
stowed in the inside. Presently the growl of a
King Charles, thrusting his head out of a muff,
proclaimed the advent of another occupant of the
two vacant seats. A gentlemanly-looking man,
with fine open features, and what was at once
written down by the old ladies as a charitable
expression, much wrapped up with shawls, etc.,
round his neck, stepped into the mail.</p>

<p>He caressed, admired, and noticed Bess. He
helped to adjust shawls, and placed the windows
entirely at the disposal of the ladies, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
looked as though he might be suffocated at any
moment.</p>

<p>The conversation was animated; the stranger
entering freely into all the views and opinions of
his fellow-travellers&mdash;politics, agriculture, history&mdash;endorsing
every opinion which they might
express. Both inwardly pronounced him a most
charming companion, and blessed the stars which
had introduced them to such society.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You reside in the neighbourhood of Charlton,
madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; we have a lovely villa on the edge of
Blackheath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blackheath! that is a favourite neighbourhood
of mine. In fact I am going to Woolwich
to join my regiment this evening, and I intend
to get out at Blackheath to enjoy an evening stroll
over the Heath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not afraid of being molested at
night over Blackheath? Isn&rsquo;t it very lonesome?&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it is lonesome, but I often meet very
useful agreeable people in rambling over the Heath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arrived at Blackheath, the two ladies descended,
and, feeling that they had established a sufficient
acquaintance with the polite gentleman who had
been their fellow-traveller, they invited him to
partake of a cup of tea at their residence before
proceeding on his journey, which invitation he
gratefully accepted.</p>

<p>As the evening wore on, a rubber of whist was
proposed, the gentleman taking &ldquo;dummy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a short lapse of time, looking at his
watch as by a sudden impulse, he observed that it
was growing late, and he was afraid he was keeping
them up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall now take my leave, deeply impressed
by your kind hospitality; but before I make my
bow I must trouble you for your watches, chains,
money, and any small articles of jewellery which
you may have in the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>The ladies looked aghast, hardly able to realise
the situation. Their guest however remained
inflexible, and having, with his own dexterous hands,
cleared the tables of all articles sufficiently portable,
was proceeding to ascend the stairs, when
one of the ladies uttered a piercing scream. On
this, he sternly assured them that silence was
their only safety, whilst giving any alarm would
be attended by instant death. Then, having
possessed himself of all the money and valuables
he could command, he left the house, telling
the ladies with a smile, that they had conferred
a most delightful and profitable evening on Mr.
Richard Turpin.</p>

<p>There are instances on record of attacks of
other descriptions upon the royal mails.
History records the strange adventure of the
Salisbury mail, on its journey from London to
Exeter in the year &mdash;&mdash;. Whilst passing the
neighbourhood of Winterslow Hut, on Salisbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Plain, the coachman&rsquo;s attention was attracted to
what he at first thought was a huge calf cantering
alongside of his leaders. The team at once became
very fretful, and evinced such fear that the driver
had some difficulty in keeping them in the road.
Suddenly the creature he had mistaken for a
calf made a lightning spring on to the back of
one of the leaders, and swinging round so as to
catch it by the throat, clung like a leech to the
paralysed and terrified animal. The guard displayed
great presence of mind, and taking his
firearms with him, ran forward and delivered a
<i>coup de grâce</i> to the attacking monster, which
proved to be a lioness escaped from a travelling
menagerie. This was her second exploit of the
kind. She had previously pounced upon a horse
drawing a carrier&rsquo;s cart, and killed, but not
mutilated, the animal, the driver being far too
much bewildered and alarmed to dream of
resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A team well put together is half driven,&rdquo;
was an old and true adage, and of more certain
application than many of the same character, as
for example: &ldquo;A bird well marked is half bagged.&rdquo;
Not a bit of it. The bird is awake, and, expecting
to be flushed again, gets up much sooner than
he is expected and flies awkwardly. &ldquo;A bottle
of physic well shaken is half taken.&rdquo; I trust my
readers have discovered this way of diminishing
the dose.</p>

<p>In illustration of the first adage, I may
mention that I had an innate love for driving,
dating from so early a period as my keeping
in my desk at school a well-matched team of
cockchafers, until, finding them too slow for
my work, I established in their place a very
fashionable team of white mice, all bred on the
premises. These when harnessed to a &ldquo;Gradus&rdquo;
as a break were very safe and steady. With
a Greek grammar or &ldquo;Delectus&rdquo; they could fly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>I inherited the love of driving from my father,
who was a very good coachman; and in early
days would frequently hang on a single leader
to his carriage, making a &ldquo;pickaxe&rdquo; team,
merely for the sake of initiating me in the
manipulation of four reins. The promotion from
donkies to ponies rather interrupted my practice;
as, though we could always borrow mokes to
make up a four-in-hand, it was not so easy to
do so with ponies.</p>

<p>A real stage-coach passed our gates twice
each day; and for the convenience of the
contractor who horsed it, a stable was built
upon my father&rsquo;s premises. The incentive given
to me by the desire to get my dismissal from
my tutor in time to see the coach change horses
conduced more to my classical acquirements
than any other circumstance.</p>

<p>The regularity of coach work is one of its
greatest merits, and operates more upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
well-conditioning of the men, horses, and all
concerned, than is usually supposed.</p>

<p>It is a pretty sight to see a team of coach horses
at a roadside change prepared and turned round,
each one listening anxiously for the horn which
proclaims the arrival of the coach, and the commencement
for them of a ten-mile stage, which
may have to be done perhaps in fifty-two minutes,
with a heavy load, woolly roads, and the wind
behind.</p>

<p>This does not sound like attraction to create
much pleasurable impatience; but such is the
fascination of coaching work that all horses,
except, of course, those underbred vulgar screws
which can take delight in nothing, whatever their
antecedents may have been, become so moulded
into their work and places (for this is a most
important feature in my text) that it perfects them
for the work expected of them in every particular.
Bad tempers are subdued and become amiable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
bad feeders become after a time so ravenous as
to be able to entertain a &ldquo;duck in their mess;&rdquo;
nervous fretful horses become bold and settled.
Old Crab, who persistently refused to drink
out of a bucket when he came here, or even to
allow a stable bucket to be brought near him,
has overcome all his scruples, and, to use the
horsekeeper&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;He wun&rsquo;t wait for
his turn, but when the bucket is &rsquo;ung on to the
nose of the pump he&rsquo;ll go and stick his old
nose in it, and begin to neigh and &rsquo;oller like
anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A coach horse, although he has apparently
few opportunities of employing his intelligence
to his own advantage, whose life is spent in the
stable, except when taken to the forge, or to the
horsepond, will evince to his employers, in spite
of this monotony, some habits and tastes which,
if he is indulged in them, will nearly double
his value. For instance, every coach horse has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a favourite place in a team, and will go well
and do well in that place; and by careful watching
it will soon become evident to the coachman and
to the horsekeeper which is the place selected by
his taste.</p>

<p>Regard to this is most important. The same
animal which becomes a &ldquo;lawyer,&rdquo; because &ldquo;he
won&rsquo;t do no more than we pay him for,&rdquo; and is
often forgotten at the near-side wheel, and is
always coming back to you if put on the off-side,
or, better still, before the bars, will be
straight, steady, and cheerful in his work, with
a mouth you might control with a thread.</p>

<p>This is when you have found out the place
with which he is pleased and satisfied. Try him
on the opposite side, and you will find him
laying his whole weight upon the pole, his
partner on your fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything in its place and a place for everything&rdquo;
was a maxim constantly preached by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
head-master of a certain public school, founded by
one Sutton; and the proof of his theory was
put to the test by a strange fancy he had
taken. He was watching the evolutions of a
small Carthusian army, under the command of a
colour-sergeant of the Scots Guards, and observed
that his first word of command was to &ldquo;fall in&rdquo;
and &ldquo;size.&rdquo; This was quickly done, and the
effect so much tickled the doctor, that, on the
following Sunday morning, when his catechism
class was arranged before him, he thought it
would be well to impress a little of the military
element into the arrangement of the boys; so
he requested the young gentlemen to take their
places according to their sizes. Of course they
were very obtuse, and could not for the life of
them understand his order. Even when he
placed them with his own hands, there was a
deal of shuffling and confusion to get back to
their old places. The doctor, however, had his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
way, and M or N, who was a short, thick,
rosy-cheeked boy, was supplanted by a tall, overgrown,
sickly-looking youth of double his stature,
and so on according to height, the lowest being
in the centre. No. 2 agreed to his &ldquo;godfather&rdquo;
and &ldquo;godmother&rdquo; having given the name of
M or N to No. 1; but he could not tell why
No. 3, when asked what his sponsors then did
for him, preserved an obstinate silence, and,
when much pressed, said they were both dead!
In fact, arranged as the class then was, if the
doctor had asked the questions in High Dutch
and expected the answers in Hebrew, he would
have got as much information; whereas, if they
had kept their own places there would not have
been a word in the answers omitted.</p>

<p class="summary">Opposition&mdash;A quick change&mdash;How to do it&mdash;Accident to the
Yeovil mail&mdash;A gallop for our lives&mdash;Unconscious passengers&mdash;Western
whips&mdash;Parliamentary obstruction.</p>

<div class="drop"><img src="images/drop_a.png" width="79" height="80" alt="A" /></div>
<p class="afterdrop"><span class="uc"><span class="hide">A</span>lthough</span> opposition was fierce, certain
rules of etiquette and honour
were most rigidly observed on the
road, which rendered immunity from accidents
much more general than would have been
supposed. It was an understood thing that
no coach should pass another actually in motion
unless invited to do so by the coachman driving
the leading coach at the time. The race became
much more exciting in cases where there was
a little diversity in the roads between two
points in the destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>The change in the fast coaches, where the
horsekeeper and his mate knew their business,
was effected in a minute and a half; and,
like everything else connected with the fast
coaches, required to be done strictly according
to rule.</p>

<p>The man receiving the leader, near or off-side,
seizes the rein behind the saddle or pad,
and draws it out of the head-terret of the
wheeler, then, doubling it several times, he passes
of it through the terret, unhooks the coch-eyes
the traces, and the leaders are free. Though
still coupled they should be accustomed to walk
aside a few paces, out of the way of the
coach.</p>

<p>The horsekeeper at the heads of the wheelers
should first double the rein through the terret,
to prevent its being trodden upon and cut; then,
by raising the end of the pole, unhook the pole-chain,
which will admit of the horse standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
back in his work, and enable the traces to be
easily lifted off the roller-bolts, the wheelers
being uncoupled before he leaves their heads.</p>

<p>The fresh team, when brought out, should
be placed behind the spot where the coach pulls
up, so that they may walk straight up into
their places without having to be turned round,
which always entails delay. The fresh team
being &ldquo;in-spanned,&rdquo; the coachman or guard (or
both) assisting in running and buckling the reins,
the business is complete.</p>

<p>However quickly the change may be effected,
it behoves a coachman to look round before he
takes his reins, as a very trifling omission may
give rise to serious delay, if not dangerous trouble.
I have known the most careful horsekeepers
forget to couple the wheel-horses, which, especially
in the dark, when it is more likely to happen,
is an omission nothing but the greatest judgment
and patience on the part of the coachman can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
render harmless, since most coach-teams, more
frequently than not, jump forward into their
work, and are not so easily stopped.</p>

<p>It is in cases of this description that so many
accidents are prevented, in the present day, by
the use of that admirable invention the patent
break. We are indebted to the French for this
very useful appliance, and although many wheel-horses
are spoiled by the too frequent use of it,
the number of accidents and broken knees which
are averted must be untold.</p>

<p>To pull up a heavily-loaded coach on a
descent requires strength of arm, as well as
power in the wheelers, to stop it; whereas, after
having stopped the coach with a good strong
break, the pulling up of the horses is comparatively
easy. How different from the days when we
had nothing but the old skid (or slipper) and
chain, which was very little used except on the
heavy coaches and over the most severe pitches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
on account of the loss of time occasioned by its
adjustment and removal.</p>

<p>Accidents, however, are not always to be
avoided by pulling-up, as I shall show by
relating an incident which occurred to me many
years ago in the West of England, in which
nothing could have saved our limbs or necks
but my having recourse to the opposite alternative,
and keeping the team at the top of
their speed for dear life.</p>

<p>I was indulging in my favourite pastime and
driving the &ldquo;Yeovil&rdquo; mail. We were full inside,
and there were two gentlemen besides the professional
coachman, Jack Everett, outside. I
had a little short-legged quick team, belonging
to Mrs. Stevens, of the Halfmoon, from Crewkerne
to Chard. They were accustomed to do this
ground very fast, but would not stop an ounce
down the hills.</p>

<p>The roads being hard and slippery, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
having a load, I took the precaution to put on
the shoe to come down Chard Hill. We were
swinging along merrily when suddenly the skid
chain, in jumping over a stone, parted. This
catastrophe allowed the coach to slip uncomfortably
and suddenly upon the shoulders and cruppers
of the wheelers, and one of them, being a bit
of a rogue, evinced his disapprobation by giving
several sudden bolting lurches and throwing
himself upon the pole.</p>

<p>In one of these evolutions more sudden and
violent than the rest the pole snapped off in the
futchells!</p>

<p>Here was a predicament! Half-way down
one of the ugliest hills in England, with a resolute
frightened team and a broken pole. Nothing
for it but to put them along and keep them
galloping. The broken pole bobbing and dancing
along at the end of the chains helped me materially
to do this. The leaders finding the bars at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
end of the whippletree all gone mad, took the
hint and went off as hard as they could lay
legs to the ground. My only care was to keep
them straight, and the pace so good as to prevent
the coach getting upon the lock, in which case
we must have gone over.</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="images/i_071.jpg" width="600" height="464" alt="THE YEOVIL MAIL." />
</div>

<p>It was a fearful moment, and never in all
my coaching experience have I passed through
such a crisis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em have it!&rdquo; cries Jack Everett.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but the pace can save us!&rdquo; cries
Fred North, the guard.</p>

<p>She rocked, they galloped, we shouted to
encourage them. Fortunately they were very
evenly matched in pace. If there had been one
shirk it must have been fatal.</p>

<p>Providence protected us on this occasion, and
I had the good fortune to keep the pace up till
we got upon a level, and then gradually stopped
her, and, by way of a finale, we had a rattling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
good kicking match before we could get the
wheelers away from the coach.</p>

<p>I have been in many coach accidents, some
of which, I regret to say, have been much more
serious in their results, but I always consider
that our lives were in greater jeopardy for the
four or five minutes after that pole snapped than
during any other epoch of my life.</p>

<p>Rarely, if ever, has there been a similar
accident upon a plain open road. Poles are
often snapped by inexperienced coachmen getting
upon the lock in attempting to turn without
room, and trusting to the strength of the pole
to drag the coach across the road.</p>

<p>Not a hundred yards from the place where
I pulled up the mail stood the yard and premises
of a working wheelwright, who improvised, in a
marvellously short time, a temporary pole, and
by attaching the main-bar to a chain leading from
the foot-bed, and splicing it to the pole, we did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
not lose three-quarters of an hour by the whole
<i>contretemps</i>. Moreover, strange to say, until the
wheelers began trying to write their names on
the front-boot at the bottom of the hill, the four
inside passengers were perfectly unconscious that
there had been anything wrong! One of the
party&mdash;a lady&mdash;remarked to me that &ldquo;the mail
travelled so delightfully fast that it appeared to
have wings instead of wheels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the iron monster had invaded England,
and the investment of the principal towns was
nearly complete, the last corner which remained
to the coaches was the far West, where the business
was carried on with great energy and spirit to the
very last.</p>

<p>Exeter became the great centre. About seventy
coaches left the city daily, Sundays excepted&mdash;the
&ldquo;Dorchester&rdquo; and &ldquo;London,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Falmouth,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Plymouth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bath,&rdquo; &ldquo;Launceston,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Truro&rdquo;
mails. The &ldquo;London&rdquo; mail (direct), commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
called the &ldquo;Quicksilver,&rdquo; was said to be the
fastest mail in England, performing the journey
(one hundred and sixty-six miles) in twenty hours,
except during fogs or heavy snow. This mail
was driven out of London by Charles Ward
(now the proprietor of the Paxton Yard, Knightsbridge),
who left the White Horse Cellars (now
the Bath Hotel), Piccadilly, at eight every
evening, until Mr. Chaplin shifted his booking
office to the Regent Circus.</p>

<p>The numerous coaches working between Exeter
and the west coast were principally horsed by
Cockrane, New London Inn; Pratt, Old London
(now the Buda), and Stevens, Halfmoon Hotel.</p>

<p>The day and night travelling was kept up
until fairly driven off by the common enemy.</p>

<p>During the two or three years before the
railway was opened this part of England became
the warm corner for coaching; and all the talent
of the road, having been elbowed out of other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
places, flocked to the West. Charles and Henry
Ward, Tim Carter, Jack Everett, Bill Harbridge,
Bill Williams, and Wood, not forgetting Jack
Goodwin, the guard, who was one of the best
key-buglers that ever rode behind a coach.</p>

<p>This incursion of talent aroused the energies
of some of the Devonshire whips engaged at
that time, M. Hervey, Sam Granville, Harry
Gillard, Paul Collyns, William Skinner, etc.</p>

<p>There were four Johnsons, all first-class coachmen,
sons of a tailor at Marlborough, who were
working up to the last days of coaching. Anthony
Deane&mdash;or Gentleman Deane, as he was commonly
called&mdash;drove the only mail left after the opening
of the rail to Plymouth&mdash;the &ldquo;Cornish&rdquo; mail to
Launceston.</p>

<p>After she was taken off the road he did not
long survive, but died at Okehampton. He was
a fine coachman, a good nurse, and an admirable
timekeeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Telegraph,&rdquo; when first put on by
Stevens of the Halfmoon, left Exeter at
6.30 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, breakfasted at Ilminster, dined at
the Star at Andover, and reached Hyde Park
Corner at 9.30 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, thus performing a journey
of one hundred and sixty-six miles in fifteen
hours, including stoppages. There was some
encouragement to coaching in those days. A good
mail was a real good property. The &ldquo;Quicksilver&rdquo;
mail and the &ldquo;Dorchester&rdquo; mail, alone,
paid the rent (twelve hundred pounds per annum)
of the New London Inn. The profits of the
former were a thousand pounds per annum; and
those of the &ldquo;Dorchester&rdquo; two hundred pounds;
the profits of the first-named being augmented by
the fact of the booking office, both ways, being
at Exeter. The mails from London on the second
of each month were always a little behind time,
being so heavily laden with the magazines and
periodicals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the tremendous pace at which the
mails travelled, accidents were very rare. All
coaches were heavily laden about Christmas time
with parcels and presents. On one occasion, the
&ldquo;Defiance&rdquo; from Exeter, with an unreasonable
top-load, was overtaken by a dense fog, and the
coachman (Beavis), getting off the road before he
got to Ilminster, was upset and the driver killed
upon the spot. An eminent friend and patron of
the road, Mr. E. A. Sanders, took the matter in
hand, and collected upwards of eight hundred
pounds for the widow and children, with which,
as the latter grew up, he started them all in life.</p>

<p>There were many fast coaches besides the
ordinary six-insider, such as the &ldquo;Balloon&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Traveller,&rdquo; from Pratt&rsquo;s, New London, the
&ldquo;Defiance,&rdquo; a fast coach, from the Clarence Hotel,
Congleton, the &ldquo;Favourite&rdquo; (subscription), and
several others.</p>

<p>In the year 1835, all the Exeter and London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
coaches were stopped by heavy snow, at Mere, on
the borders of Salisbury Plain. Amongst the
passengers were the late Earl of Devon, the
Bishop of Exeter, Mr. Charles Buller, and seven
other members of Parliament, all on their way
to attend the opening of the session. They were
delayed a whole week.</p>

<p>As the London coaches were gradually knocked
off by the advance of the rail, the competition
upon other roads out of Exeter became more
rife, and the opposition warmer.</p>

the &ldquo;Warwick Crown Prince,&rdquo; and,
at the time I adopted it, was driven by Jack
Everett, who was reckoned in his day to be
as good a nurse, and to have fingers as fine,
as anybody in the profession.</p>

<p>He took the coach from The Swan with
Two Necks, in Ladd Lane, to Dunstable, and
there split the work with young Johnson, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
though sixty years of age, had three older
brothers on the bench. &ldquo;Spicy Jack&rdquo; was the
beau ideal of a sporting whip. He was always
dressed to the letter, though his personal
appearance had been very much marred by
two coach accidents, in each of which he
fractured a leg. The first one having been
hurriedly set a little on the bow, he wished
to have the other arranged as much like it as
possible; the result being that they grew very
much in the form of a horse-collar. These
&ldquo;crook&rsquo;d legs,&rdquo; as he called them, reduced his
stature to about five feet three inches. He
had a clean-shaved face, short black hair, sharp
intelligent blue eyes, a very florid complexion,
rather portly frame, clad in the taste of the
period: A blue coat, buttons very widely apart
over the region of the kidneys, looking as if
they had taken their places to fight a duel,
rather than belonging to the same coat. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
large kersey vest of a horsecloth pattern; a
startling blue fogle and breast-pin; drab overalls,
tightly fitted to the ankle and instep of
a Wellington boot, strapped under the foot
with a very narrow tan-coloured strap. The
whole surmounted by a drab, napless hat, with
rather a brim, producing a &ldquo;slap-up&rdquo; effect.</p>

<p>When at the local race-meetings, &ldquo;Spicy Jack&rdquo;
dashed on to the course in a sporting yellow mail-phaeton,
his whip perpendicular, his left hand
holding the reins just opposite the third button
of his waistcoat from the top. Driving a pair
of &ldquo;tits&rdquo; which, though they had both chipped
their knees against their front teeth, and one of
them (a white one) worked in suspicious boots,
produced such an impression upon the yokels that
no one but &ldquo;Spicy Jack&rdquo; could come on to a
racecourse in such form.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>All this appeared like &ldquo;cheek,&rdquo; but it was
quite the reverse; for in spite of the familiarity
which was universally extended to this &ldquo;sporting
whip,&rdquo; he never forgot his place with a gentleman,
and a more respectful man in his avocation did
not exist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, what are we backing?&rdquo; was
the salutation of a noble lord who had given
him a fiver to invest to the best of his judgment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my lord; we are not in the
robbery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that? we shall lose a race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, my lord, it was all squared
and the plunder divided before I could get on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody knew the ropes at Harpenden, Barnet,
and St. Albans, when the platers ran to amuse
the public, and the public &ldquo;greased the ropes,&rdquo;
better than the waggoner of the &ldquo;Crown Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a rest day and the &ldquo;spare man&rdquo; works.
Let us take a full load away from Ladd Lane.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Ten and four with all their luggage; roof piled,
boots chock full, besides a few candle-boxes in
the cellar.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> She groans and creaks her way
through the city, carefully, yet boldly driven by
our artist, and when she leaves her London team
at the Hyde and emerges into an open road, she
steals away at her natural pace, which, from the
evenness of its character, is very hard to beat.</p>

<p>There was one coach, and only one, which could
give these fast stage-coaches ten minutes and beat
them over a twelve-mile stage!</p>

<p>It was before the legislature forbade the use of
dogs as animals of draught, that there dwelt upon
the Great North Road, sometimes in one place,
sometimes in another, an old pauper who was born
without legs, and, being of a sporting turn of mind,
had contrived to get built for himself a small
simple carriage, or waggon, very light, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
nothing but a board for the body, but fitted
with springs, lamps, and all necessary appliances.</p>

<p>To this cart he harnessed four fox-hounds,
though to perform his quickest time he preferred
three abreast. He carried nothing, and lived upon
the alms of the passengers by the coaches. His
team were cleverly harnessed and well matched
in size and pace. His speed was terrific, and as
he shot by a coach going ten or twelve miles an
hour, he would give a slight cheer of encouragement
to his team; but this was done in no spirit
of insolence or defiance, merely to urge the hounds
to their pace. Arriving at the end of the stage,
the passengers would find poor &ldquo;Old Lal&rdquo; hopping
on his hands to the door of the hostelry, whilst
his team, having walked out into the road, would
throw themselves down to rest and recover their
wind. For many years poor Old Lal continued
his amateur competition with some of the fastest
and best-appointed coaches on the road; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
favourite ground being upon the North Road,
between the Peacock at Islington and the Sugarloaf
at Dunstable. The latter place was his
favourite haven of rest. He had selected it in
consequence of a friendship he had formed with
one Daniel Sleigh, a double-ground horsekeeper,
and the only human being who was in any way
enlightened as to the worldly affairs of this poor
legless beggar.</p>

<p>Daniel Sleigh, as the sequel will prove, richly
deserved the confidence so unreservedly placed in
him&mdash;a confidence far exceeding the mutual sympathies
of ordinary friendship; and Daniel Sleigh
became Old Lal&rsquo;s banker, sworn to secrecy.</p>

<p>Years went on, during which the glossy coats
of Lal&rsquo;s team on a bright December morning&mdash;to
say nothing of their condition&mdash;would have
humbled the pride of some of the crack kennel
huntsmen of the shires. When asked how he
fed his hounds, he was wont to say: &ldquo;I never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
feed them at all. They know all the hog-tubs
down the road, and it is hard if they can&rsquo;t satisfy
themselves with somebody else&rsquo;s leavings.&rdquo; Where
they slept was another affair; but it would seem
that they went out foraging in couples, as Old Lal
declared that there were always two on duty with
the waggon.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>When the poor old man required the use of
his hands, it was a matter of some difficulty to
keep his perpendicular, his nether being shaped
like the fag-end of a farthing rushlight; and he
was constantly propped up against a wall to
polish the brass fittings of his harness. In this
particular his turnout did him infinite credit.
Of course his most intimate, and indeed only
friend, Dan Sleigh, supplied him with oil and
rotten-stone when he quartered at Dunstable;
and brass, when once cleaned and kept in daily
use, does not require much elbow-grease. Lal&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
travelling attire was simplicity itself. His wardrobe
consisted of nothing but waistcoats, and
these garments, having no peg whereon to hang
except the poor old man&rsquo;s shoulders, he usually
wore five or six, of various hues; the whole
topped by a long scarlet livery waistcoat. These,
with a spotted shawl round his neck, and an old
velvet hunting-cap upon his head, completed his
costume.</p>

<p>The seat of Lal&rsquo;s waggon was like an
inverted beehive. It would have puzzled a man
with legs to be the companion of his daily
journeys. These generally consisted of an eight-mile
stage and back, or, more frequently, two
consecutive stages of eight and ten miles.</p>

<p>An interval of several years elapsed, during
which I did not visit the Great North Road.
When at length I did so, I hastened to inquire
for my old friends, many of whom I found had
disappeared from the scene&mdash;coachmen changed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
retired, or dead; horsekeepers whom I had known
from my boyhood, shifted, discharged, or dead.</p>

<p>Under any other circumstances than driving
a coach rapidly through the air of a fine brisk
autumnal morning, at the rate of eleven miles an
hour, including stoppages, the answers to my
inquiries would have been most depressing.</p>

<p>Dunstable was the extent of my work for
that day, which afforded me the opportunity of
working back on the following morning.</p>

<p>Arrived at The Sugarloaf, gradually slackening
my pace and unbuckling my reins, I pulled up
within an inch of the place whence I had so
often watched every minute particular in the
actions of the finished professionals.</p>

<p>D&mdash;&mdash; was the place at which the coach dined,
and, being somewhat sharp set, I determined to
dine with the coach, though I should have to
spend the evening in one of the dullest provincial
towns in England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>I had brought a full load down. The coaches
dined in those days upon the fat of the land.
Always one hot joint (if not two) awaited the
arrival of the coach, and the twenty minutes
allotted for the refreshment of the inward passenger
were thoroughly utilised.</p>

<p>A boiled round of beef, a roast loin of pork,
a roast aitchbone of beef, and a boiled hand of
pork with peas-pudding and parsnips, a roast
goose and a boiled leg of mutton, frequently
composed a <i>menu</i> well calculated to amuse a
hungry passenger for the short space allotted him.</p>

<p>The repast concluded and the coach reloaded,
I watched her ascend the hill at a
steady jog till she became a mere black spot
in the road. I then directed my steps to the
bottom of the long range of red-brick buildings
used as coach-stables, where I found old Daniel
Sleigh still busily engaged in what he called
&ldquo;Setting his &rsquo;osses fair.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>This implied the washing legs, drying flanks,
and rubbing heads and ears of the team I had
brought in half-an-hour ago. Although the old
man looked after the &ldquo;in-and-out&rdquo; horses, he
always designated the last arrival as &ldquo;My
&rsquo;osses,&rdquo; and they consequently enjoyed the
largest share of Dan&rsquo;s attention: &ldquo;Bill the
Brewer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Betsy Mare,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old Giles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dan Sleigh was a specimen of the old-fashioned
horsekeeper, a race which has now
become obsolete. He had lived with Mrs.
Nelson, who was one of the largest coach
proprietors of the period, for thirty-nine years,
always having charge of a double team. He
rarely conversed with anybody but &ldquo;his &rsquo;osses,&rdquo;
with whom, between the h&mdash;i&mdash;ss&mdash;e&mdash;s which
accompanied every action of his life, he carried
on a <i>sotto voce</i> conversation, asking questions
as to what they did with them, at the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
end, and agreeing with himself as to the
iniquitous system of taking them out of the
coach and riding them into the horsepond, then
leaving them to dry whilst Ben Ball&mdash;the other
horsekeeper&mdash;went round to the tap to have
half-a-pint of beer. <i>O tempora! O mores!</i></p>

<p>Many of his old friends had fallen victims
to this cruel treatment. A recent case had
occurred in the death of old Blind Sal, who
had worked over the same ground for thirteen
years, and never required a hand put to her,
either from the stable to the coach or from
the coach to the stable. She caught a chill
in the horsepond, and died of acute inflammation.</p>

<p>When I interrupted old Dan he was just
&ldquo;hissing&rdquo; out his final touches, and beginning
to sponge the dirt off his harness. He
recognised me with a smile&mdash;a shilling smile&mdash;and
the following dialogue ensued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Daniel Sleigh was a man who, to use his own
words, &ldquo;kep&rsquo; &rsquo;isself to &rsquo;isself.&rdquo; He never went
to &ldquo;no public &rsquo;ouses, nor yet no churches.&rdquo; He
had never altered his time of getting up or going
to bed for forty years; and, except when he lay
in the &ldquo;horsepital&rdquo; six weeks, through a kick
from a young horse, he had never been beyond
the smithy for eleven years. In any other grade
of life he would have been a &ldquo;recluse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His personal appearance was not engaging&mdash;high
cheek-bones, small gray sunken eyes, a large
mouth, and long wiry neck, with broad shoulders,
a little curved by the <i>anno domini</i>; clothed
always in one style, namely, a long plush vest,
which might have been blue once; a pair of drab
nethers, well veneered with blacking and harness
paste; from which was suspended a pair of black
leather leggings, meeting some thin ankle-jacks.
This, with a no-coloured string, which had once
been a necktie, and a catskin cap, completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
his attire. My attention had been attracted to
an old hound&mdash;a fox-hound&mdash;reclining at full
length on his side on the pathway leading to
the stables, his slumbers broken by sudden jerks
of his body and twitches of his limbs, accompanied
by almost inaudible little screams; leading me
to suppose that this poor old hound was reviewing
in his slumbers some of the scenes of his early
life, and dreaming of bygone November days
when he had taken part in the pursuit of some
good straight-necked fox in the Oakley or the
Grafton country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that hound?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;He looks
like one of poor Old Lal&rsquo;s team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the <i>last</i> on &rsquo;em. They are all
gone now but poor old Trojan, and he gets very
weak and old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When I noticed him he slowly rose, and
sauntered across the yard towards a large open
coachhouse, used as a receptacle for hearses and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
mourning-coaches. He did not respond to my
advances, except by standing still and looking
me in the face with the most wobegone expression
possible, his deep brow almost concealing
his red eyes. He was very poor, his long staring
coat barely covering his protruding hips and ribs.
There he stood, motionless, as if listening intently
to the sad tale Daniel Sleigh was graphically
relating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what has become of poor Old Lal?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s left this two years or more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whither is he gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as he&rsquo;s gone anywheres; they
took him up to the churchyard to be left till
called for. You see, sir, he never &rsquo;ad no kins nor
directors (executors), or anybody as cared whether
they ever see him again or not. He was an
honest man though a wagrant; which he never
robbed nobody, nor ever had any parish relief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
What money he had I used to take care of for
him; and when he went away he had a matter
of sixteen pounds twelve and twopence, which I
kep&rsquo; for him, only as he wanted now and again tenpence
or a shilling to give a treat to his hounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did he die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s what nobody knows nothing about.
You see, sir, it was as this: He&rsquo;d been on the
road a-many years; but as he had no house in
particular, nobody noticed when he came and
when he went; when he laid here o&rsquo; nights, he
used to sleep in the hay-house. The boys in the
town would come down and harness up his team
and set him fair for the day. He would go away
with one of the up-coaches, and not be here again
for a week (perhaps more). Well, there was one
time, it was two years agone last March, I hadn&rsquo;t
seen nothing of Lal not for three weeks or a
month; the weather was terrible rough, there was
snow and hice; and the storm blowed down a-many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
big trees, and them as stood used to &rsquo;oller and
grunt up in the Pine Bottom, so that I&rsquo;ve heerd
folks say that the fir-trees a-rubbing theirselves
against one another, made noises a nights like a
pack of hounds howling; and people were afraid to
go down the Pine Bottom for weeks, and are now,
for a matter of that. For they do say as poor Old
Lal drives down there very often in the winter
nights. Well, one Sunday afternoon I had just
four-o&rsquo;clocked my &rsquo;osses, and was a-popping a sack
over my shoulders to go down to my cottage; it
was sleeting and raining, and piercing cold, when
who should I meet but poor old Trojan. He come
up, rubbed my hand with his nose, and seemed
quite silly with pleasure at seeing me. Now,
though I&rsquo;ve known him on and off this five or six
year, I never knew him do the like before. He
had a part of his harness on, which set me a
thinking that he had cut and run, and perhaps
left Old Lal in trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>&rdquo;You see, sir, what a quiet sullen dog he is.
Always like that, never moves hisself quickly.
Still, when he come to me that Sunday, he was
quite different; he kep&rsquo; trotting along the road,
and stopping a bit, then he&rsquo;d look round, then
come and lay hold of the sack and lead me along
by it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next day there was another of poor Old
Lal&rsquo;s team come to our place (Rocket), and he
had part of his breast-collar fastened to him.
They were both pretty nigh starved to death.
Trojan he went on with these man&oelig;uvres,
always trying to &rsquo;tice me down to the road leading
to the Pine Bottom. Word was sent up and down
the road by the guards and coachmen to inquire
where Old Lal had been last seen. No tidings
could be got, and strange tales got abroad. Some
said the hounds had killed and eaten him! Some
that he had been robbed and murdered! No
tidings could be got. Still old Trojan seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
always to point the same way, and would look
pleased and excited if I would only go a little
way down the road towards the Pine Bottom
with him.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Many men joined together and agreed to
make a search, but nothing could be found in
connection with the poor old man; so they gave
it up. One morning after my coach had gone,
I determined to follow old Trojan. The poor
old dog was overjoyed, and led me right down
to the Pine Bottom. I followed him pretty near
a mile through the trees and that, until at last
we come upon poor Old Lal&rsquo;s waggon. There was
his seat, there was part of the harness, and there
lay, stone-dead, one of the hounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No trace could be found of the poor old man,
and folks were more puzzled than ever about his
whereabouts.</p>

<p>&rdquo;It seemed as though the waggon had got
set fast between the trees, and Trojan and Rocket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
had bitten themselves free, the third, a light-coloured
one (a yellow one), had died.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The finding of the waggon set all the country
up to search for poor Old Lal, but it wasn&rsquo;t for
more&rsquo;n a week after finding the waggon, that
Trojan and Rocket pointed out by their action
where to go and look for the poor old man. And
he was found, but it was a long ways off from his
waggon. There he lay, quite comfortable, by the
side of a bank. The crowner said the hounds
had given chase to something (maybe a fox crossed
&rsquo;em) and clashed off the road, throw&rsquo;d the poor old
man off&mdash;perhaps stunned with the fall&mdash;and the
hounds had persevered through the wood till the
waggon got locked up in the trees. And there
the poor things lay and would have died if they
had not gnawed themselves out of their harness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what was the verdict?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there was no verdic&rsquo;! They never
found that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There must have been some opinion given.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jury said he was a pauper wagrant, that
he had committed accidental death, and the
crowner sentenced him to be buried in the parish
in which he was last seen alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had he any friends or relatives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he said he never had any. He had
no name, only Lal. Old Trojan has been with
me ever since we followed a short square box
up to the churchyard, containing the body of
poor Old Lal, where we left it. There was
nobody attended the funeral only we two. If
the old dog ever wanders away for a day or
two, he allers comes back more gloomier like
than he looks now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old hound had been standing in the same
attitude, apparently a most attentive listener to
this sad tale, and when I attempted a pat of
sympathy he turned round and threaded his way
through the crowd of mourning-coaches; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Daniel Sleigh informed me that the wreck of
poor Old Lal&rsquo;s waggon had been stowed away
at the back of this melancholy group. Upon this
the old hound usually lay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what about Rocket?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a younger and more ramblier dog.
He never settled nowhere. The last I heerd of
him, he had joined a pack of harriers (a trencher
pack) at Luton. He was kinder master of them,
frequently collecting the whole pack and going
a-hunting with them by hisself. He was allers
wonderful fond of sport. I mind one time when
a lot of boys had bolted a hotter just above the
mill, and was a-hunting him with all manner of
dogs, Old Lal happened to come along with his
waggon. The whole team bolted down to the
water&rsquo;s edge, and just at that moment the hotter
gave them a view. The hue-gaze<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> was too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
for Rocket. He plunged in, taking with him
the waggon and the other two hounds. Poor
Old Lal bobbed up and down like a fishing-float,
always keeping his head up, though before he
could be poked out he was as nigh drownded as
possible. And this is what makes me think
Rocket was the instigator of the poor old man&rsquo;s
death. He must have caught a view of a fox,
perhaps, or, at any rate, have crossed a line of
scent, and bolted off the road and up through
the wood, and after they had throwed the poor
old man, continued the chase till the waggon
got hung fast to a tree and tied them all
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there any wound or fracture about
poor Old Lal&rsquo;s body which might have caused
his death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;None whatever; no mark, no sign of violence
which could have caused his death. They do say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
he is often heerd &rsquo;ollering for help o&rsquo; nights since
he has been buried. There&rsquo;s a-many people won&rsquo;t
go through the Pine Bottom after dark to save
their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="uc"><span class="hide">W</span>hen</span> driving the coaches in the olden
time, it frequently happened that I
remained for the night at the stage
from which I should take the coach back on
the following day. On one of these occasions
I accidentally spent the evening in the commercial-room
at &mdash;&mdash;. I say &ldquo;accidentally,&rdquo;
because in all provincial hotels the bagman&rsquo;s
room is considered sacred to commercial
travellers, and I have been informed by landlords
that any intrusion upon them would
prove dangerous to the house&rsquo;s popularity. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
had dined early, and, unaware of the trespass,
happened to look into a long, dreary, deserted
room, with &ldquo;Coffee-room&rdquo; written upon the
door; a stale number of &ldquo;The Illustrated News&rdquo;
and a well-thumbed Post Office Directory upon
the table; a very bad fire, and altogether the
air of a methodist meeting-house on a weekday.
I turned to another room, in which were
three or four gentlemen, who appeared to be
surrounded by every comfort; coats, hats,
wrappers, hung in clusters against the wall,
and a cheerful fire.</p>

<p>A stout round-faced man, much marked
by smallpox, dressed in a suit of tweed dittos,
with an elaborate pin in his necktie resembling
the dial of a good-sized watch, appeared to be
the senior officer or &ldquo;boss&rdquo; of the party, as
much in manner and bearing as he was in
size. Addressing a small-featured, light-haired,
thin young man, dressed in black-silk waist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>coat,
he said in a stentorian voice: &ldquo;Have
you done floating here, Mr. Ruffins?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Staines; I&rsquo;ve not done yet. I&rsquo;ve
quoted twice. My people won&rsquo;t let me sink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A third party, an older man, attired in gray,
with hair to match, was busily engaged at one
end of the room packing a quantity of small cases
into a larger one, and continuing to hold converse
with himself by means of the monosyllable &ldquo;yes,&rdquo;
differently intonated, at intervals of half-a-minute,
&ldquo;y-e-s&mdash;y-e-s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having finished his packing, he advanced
slowly towards me, and, scanning me from head
to foot, resumed his affirmative expression, but at
longer intervals.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been round this way before&mdash;y-e-s? Bulk
or samples&mdash;yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answer to his first question I informed him
that I was no stranger to the place, to which he
replied: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Desks were now locked and stowed away.
The table having been cleared, the stout man
advanced, stirred the fire, and rang the bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give your orders, gents. I am going to
stand glasses round, for a slice of luck I&rsquo;ve experienced
to-day. <i>I</i> call it luck, though it was
no more than common honesty. But I was
lucky in meeting an honest man instead of a
rogue. When I was on this circuit six months
ago I was settling a small account with one of
my clients, taking a receipt for the amount, four
pounds seventeen shillings. I inadvertently handed
him a cheque for seventeen pounds, saying to the
clerk to whom I paid it: &lsquo;You may keep the
balance.&rsquo; The other cheque having been paid in
in due course, I was quite ignorant of the error
I had made; until, on meeting the party to whom
I paid it, in the street this morning, although now
thrown out of employ, he handed me twelve
pounds three shillings, the balance of my cheque,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
which I thought had been drawn for five
pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One bottom of brandy and two whiskies,
with hot water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Draw round to the fire, sir,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;Though we have not met before we may often
meet again. We travellers do run against each
other in strange ways.&rdquo; (Here the gray old
man groaned out another &ldquo;Y-e-s.&rdquo;) &ldquo;The commercial
interest of this great country is entirely
in our hands, and if we don&rsquo;t take care of
ourselves it is our own fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smoking tumblers having been supplied,
and the party seated round the fire, the conversation
became gradually more brisk, chiefly
led by the man in gray, whose opinion on all
points seemed absolute.</p>

<p>I was a tacit listener, understanding very
little of that part of the conversation which related
to business, viz.: &ldquo;Quoting 7-18ths at 223 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
sliding 347 and 19 net;&rdquo; but at length anecdotes
and experience took the place of business, and
proved intensely amusing.</p>

<p>I should have enjoyed the occasion if I could
have divested myself of the idea that, as regards
my vocation, I was an impostor, with no right
to be there.</p>

<p>It was evident that the gray man of the
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; had his suspicions as to my not being a
member of the craft.</p>

<p>Many glances he directed at me, each accompanied
by a muttered &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; All doubts upon
the subject were at length dispelled by a question
from the little man in the black-silk waistcoat,
Mr. Ruffins, who abruptly inquired:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your route from here? Who are
your clients?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not here,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;on any particular
business, and, to own the truth, gentlemen, I
doubt if I have any in this room.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, sir, did I not see you on the
coach this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came by the coach, and shall return with
it to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we shall be fellow-travellers. I leave
my trap here, and return to &mdash;&mdash; by the coach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gray man now commenced an anecdote,
which I shall give in his own words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in the winter of 1855. I was on
the northern circuit, in the midst of a terrific
snowfall which buried everything.</p>

<p>&rdquo;At dusk one evening the wind rose and caused
the snow to drift in heaps so quickly that I lost
the road. My horse became frightened, and I
could scarcely induce him to proceed. I did,
however, force him on till I came to a small
roadside inn, at which the mail changed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I determined to leave my horse and
trap and proceed by the coach. It was a fearful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
night, snow falling thickly, icy cold, and the
roads almost impassable. The mail was three
hours late, and when it did arrive there was
question of the advisability of proceeding farther.
I found at the inn a traveller who was storm-staid,
and, whilst waiting in the bar-parlour
for the arrival of the mail, displayed the most
marked impatience, constantly breaking out into
ejaculations.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Oh dear, oh dear! what a disappointment!
But if I can&rsquo;t get there I can&rsquo;t. Never was late
before&mdash;such a lot of people too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tried in vain to reconcile him to the
delay. He could do nothing but lament the
accident which seemed likely to prevent his
keeping his appointment at Durham on the
following day.</p>

<p>&rdquo;As we became more intimate I condoled with
him, hinting that such anxiety led me to fear
that it was a matter of life and death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It <i>is</i> a matter of life and death,&rsquo; he exclaimed.
&lsquo;If I can&rsquo;t get there in time, I shall
be ready to hang myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Time wore on. The mail at length drew up,
making that peculiar squeaking noise through the
deep snow which indicates the heaviest draught
for the horses, which were sobbing and sweating,
the wet pouring in streams from their sides; the
delay having been caused by the coach having
got into a drift, from which it had been with
difficulty extricated by a plough-team.</p>

<p>&rdquo;The change being effected, we took our places
inside, and, travelling under great difficulty, we
jogged on; the guard occasionally getting down
to feel for the road with a stick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sympathised with my fellow-traveller, and
encouraged him by expressing my conviction that
we should arrive at Durham at four <span class="small">A.M.</span>, instead
of the usual hour, eleven <span class="small">P.M.</span>; but it proved
difficult to reconcile him even to this delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>&rdquo;Thus we passed hour after hour; the wheels
of the mail groaning and squeaking through the
drifted snow, and the horses frequently brought
to a walk. By dint of perseverance, however,
and the pluck of the coachman, we did arrive
at Durham at half-past four <span class="small">A.M.</span>, five hours late.
When we alighted at the Crown I was surprised
to find that my fellow-traveller appeared to excite
in the night-porter a sneer of disgust. Turning
his whole attention to <i>my</i> luggage, he allowed the
man to snatch up his own valise and depart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nice company you&rsquo;ve got into,&rsquo; growled
boots.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he stop here?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you, we don&rsquo;t accommodate gentlemen
of <i>his</i> profession. They make room for him
when they want him at the county gaol.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who and what is he?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know him? That&rsquo;s the hangman;
and he brings that there trunk with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to take away his perquisites, which is the wearing
apparel of the poor wretch he&rsquo;s a-going to swing
off at eight o&rsquo;clock this morning; and the mail
being so late, he has only just saved his bacon
this journey.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Having finished his tale, the gray man looked
hard at me, and again uttered his favourite
&ldquo;Y-e-s,&rdquo; which this time I was half inclined to
interpret into a warning to his friend that, whilst
encouraging outsiders in the bagman&rsquo;s room, they
might be entertaining an executioner unawares.</p>

<p>Travelling by public conveyances naturally
leads to strange rencounters. It has often happened
that wealth has been acquired, lost friends restored,
estates bought and sold, etc., entirely through
accidental meetings on the road. Men without
heirs have been known in many instances to
adopt a fellow-traveller, either from the fact of
finding a person possessing the same name, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
from some trifling civility or sacrifice being made
in their favour by a stranger during a long and
perhaps irksome journey.</p>

<p>There is no doubt people became acquainted,
as a general rule, and shook off the rigid
forms of etiquette&mdash;so essentially English&mdash;much
more readily during the days of the coach
travelling than now; but on the other hand,
one may escape more quickly from objectionable
fellow-travellers, from whom in the coaching
days there was no escape till the end of
the journey.</p>

<p>This inconvenience was more felt on the
Continent than in England, where the passengers
were divided into three lots, or compartments&mdash;front,
back, and inside; whereas the interior
of the diligence, carrying ten persons, contained
barely room for each person to sit upright.</p>

<p>I was once returning from Madrid to Paris,
after having accomplished a riding tour through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Spain, visiting most of the principal towns.
On quitting Madrid I rode to Bayonne, where,
my horse having a bad sore back, I left him,
and proceeded by diligence.</p>

<p>Some consternation was caused on our arrival
at the hotel at Bayonne by the mispronunciation
of one of my travelling companions.</p>

<p>We had lived very sparely during our
riding tour, oil and garlic predominating to
such a degree in all the second-class &ldquo;fondas&rdquo;
in Spain, as to prevent an English palate
taking food, except he cooked it himself. As
we were a party of three, this difficulty was
easily got over by our taking it in turns to
make the omelettes, or spatchcock a fowl at
our different halting-places. This sort of diet
had naturally sharpened our appetites, and even
the &ldquo;sniff&rdquo; of a real French dinner made us
ravenous. Influenced by this feeling, Colonel
C&mdash;&mdash;ll, addressing our hostess of The Hôtel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
de France, exclaimed: &ldquo;Avez-vous assez, madame,
parce-que j&rsquo;ai beaucoup de femmes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor woman looked thunderstruck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mais, monsieur, vous m&rsquo;avez rien dit de
ça! Où sont-elles donc ces dames?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I need not say that her notion that the
colonel was a Turkish pasha, travelling with
his harem, was soon dispelled when we took
our places at the table-d&rsquo;hôte <i>en garçon</i>.</p>

<a href="images/i_123-large.jpg"><img src="images/i_123.jpg" width="600" height="268" alt="THE OLD FLY WAGGON." /></a>
</div>

<p>In the old days of &ldquo;fly-waggons,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> the only
means of transit for heavy goods, except by canal,
the cart horse was an animal now almost extinct.
He was never expected to move beyond a walk,
but this walk was almost perpetual motion. He
took all his food, and I may say his rest, while
strolling along by day and night in the waggon.
The halting-places were few and far between,
and were made more for the accommodation of
the few passengers who were carried in the
&ldquo;crate&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> than for the convenience of the horses.
In those days the brewers and millers emulated
each other in the size and condition of their
horses; one constantly met in the streets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
London a mountain of a horse, seventeen and a
half hands high, loaded with flesh, legs like an
elephant, drawing one small nine-gallon cask
(perhaps empty) upon a truck. <i>Mais tout cela
est changé.</i></p>

<p>All waggons are now vans, cart horses
machiners, and must trot at least six miles an
hour. We now take for our model the Clydesdale
and the Suffolk in preference to the Flemish
and the Yorkshire. Even in agricultural work
the style of horses and the rate of ploughing
is widely different from that of half a century
ago. In this particular the afternoon of the
worn-out coach horse or hunter is rendered less
irksome to him than formerly, as he can more
readily accommodate himself to a good fair
walk than to be always snatching at the
chains only to find he must come back to his
partners.</p>

<p>Weight in a horse is a great element in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
composition for purposes of heavy draught; but
it should be taken into consideration that he has
to carry that weight in addition to the work
which is expected from him; and for every
ounce by which he is assisted in weight, his
strain in draught is increased three pounds, and
so on proportionately.</p>

<p>Treating the subject of draught, there is no
more practical illustration of the way in which
the subject is understood by the animals themselves
than is afforded by the long string of
mules which are attached to carriages, both
private and public, in crossing the Alps. The
mode of putting them together is by having
two at the wheel, with a continuous long string
in single file before them, often as many as
seventeen or twenty. The intelligence shown by
these animals in threading the side of a mountain
by a zigzag road is remarkable. Each mule, as
he arrives at the angle, ceases to pull, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
knowing that having turned out of the straight
line the weight of his draught would be rather
an impediment to progress.</p>

<p>I write feelingly upon the instinct of the
Italian mules, having been once indebted to their
sagacity and obedience for my escape from what
might have been a very serious accident.</p>

<p>I was travelling from Turin to Paris. The
journey over Mont Cenis was then only to be
performed by Fell&rsquo;s railway, or by the road, by
diligence or private carriage. I took the latter,
making a contract for the posting, and not
binding the <i>maître de poste</i> to any limited
number of mules for the ascent. It was in the
month of December, and at the time I left Susa,
at five <span class="small">P.M.</span>, the snow was falling so thickly that
by the time I had completed half the ascent, the
road or track was completely obliterated. It was
a beautiful moonlight night. I was lost in
admiration of the manner in which the nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
mules, attached to a light travelling carriage,
wended their way over the trackless snow.</p>

<p>The stupendous mountains, clothed in all the
sombre grandeur of their winter attire, surged
up before me, peeping, as it were, into the deep
chasms beneath, on the very verge of which the
mules moved cautiously along.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to watch, where the road
twisted and turned almost at right angles, the
careful manner in which each animal in turn
dropped out of his work till they were again in
the straight running.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the beauty of the scenery
and the interest with which I watched the long
string of mules, which appeared at times to be
actually balancing themselves upon the narrow
ledges, I was not without anxiety, partly, perhaps,
on account of a friend to whom I
had given a seat in my carriage. He had
recently broken his leg at Turin, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
taking the earliest opportunity of a safe escort
to London.</p>

<p>The driver had no more direct control over
the mules than could be conveyed by his voice,
though I must do him the justice to say that
when he did open his mouth he did so to some
purpose.</p>

<p>His mules, however, did not often require
reproof, and a short grunt, with the name Garibaldi
or Emanuel, sufficed to make them spring forward
as if they were ashamed of being named before
strangers.</p>

<p>The driver himself frequently makes short
cuts across the angles of the road as he plods
through the snow, leaving the mules to thread
their way entirely according to their own
judgment.</p>

<p>It was on one of these occasions, when the
driver loitering out of sight, perhaps to cut
his tobacco, was absent somewhat longer than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
usual, that the mules appeared to be feeling
their way with more than ordinary caution,
while the uneasy motion of the carriage indicated
that we were not travelling upon a plain
surface. Almost instinctively, I ejaculated at
the top of my voice, imitating as near as I
could the driver&rsquo;s intonation: &ldquo;Wo-a-a-h!&rdquo;
Every mule stopped dead short. If they had
not done so, or moved on one single inch,
this incident would never have been recorded
by me!</p>

<p>Opening the door of the carriage I beheld
a frightful precipice, over which we were
literally hanging; while, turning round in order
to step out with greater caution, I found that
the weight of my body perforated the lightly-packed
snow, and that I could not feel the
ground beneath it. Had it not been for the
firm grip I had of the wing of the carriage,
I must inevitably have been precipitated into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the abyss of snow-covered boulders many
hundred feet deep below.</p>

<p>When I had recovered my footing by clinging
to the wheels of the carriage, I found that
there was not more than an inch of ground
between us and eternity. Thus, but for the
admirable patience and obedience of the mules,
we must in another instant have been launched
bodily down the precipice.</p>

<p>We looked round in vain for the driver,
and it was not till I had succeeded in pulling
out my lame companion, and seating him in
the snow, that I saw the fellow come strolling
up the hill in a cloud of tobacco smoke, singing
at the top of his voice one of the
patois refrains.</p>

<p>To punch his head was my first impulse;
but this was soon dispelled by the duties imposed
on me at this moment of peril.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/i_133-large.jpg"><img src="images/i_133.jpg" width="600" height="379" alt="OVER MOUNT CENIS IN A MULE CARRIAGE." /></a>
</div>

<p>First, if the mules moved an inch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
carriage, with baggage, etc., must have lost its
balance and gone down.</p>

<p>Second, the attention required by my poor
friend, who, unable to stand in consequence of
his accident, sat by the roadside in the snow,
praying me to seek for his crutches.</p>

<p>Third, the doubt if it would be wise to
unhitch the mules from the carriage, a dangerous
experiment, as I verily believe the weight
of the carriage was sustained in a great measure
by the traces of the wheelers.</p>

<p>There are upon Mont Cenis houses of Refuge,
at intervals of about an English mile, occupied
by people employed by the Government, to render
assistance and shelter to travellers who may be
overtaken by snowstorms. Countless lives have
been rescued by means of the appliances which
these afford. They are conducted upon something
the same principle as our Humane Society. During
the winter season when the snow drifts, it is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
uncommon thing for travellers to be snow-staid
in these Refuges for eight or ten days.</p>

<p>On the occasion of which I write the snow
continued to fall thickly, and, there being wind
enough to cause a drift, I was anxious to get my
sick friend into one of these houses with as little
delay as possible.</p>

<p>Now came the difficulty. To get the carriage
back on to the road without letting it slip over
the ridge required skilful engineering. The mules
at the wheels hung on with exemplary perseverance.
Had they relaxed in the slightest
degree the carriage must have taken them, and
probably some more of the string, down the
frightful precipice.</p>

<p>The intelligent animals appeared to understand
the situation as well as we, and scarcely
needed the driver&rsquo;s ceaseless cautious &ldquo;W-o-a-a-h!
w-o-a-a-h!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I decided first upon lightening the carriage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
by removal of the heavier luggage. This I did
with the double view of relieving the mules from
the strain they were maintaining, and of rescuing
some at least of our worldly goods from impending
danger. Whilst thus engaged the snow continued
to fall in such blinding clouds as to darken the
air; and the wind drifted it, and hurried it about,
half burying every article of baggage as we
detached it in turn from the carriage.</p>

<p>My next object was to rescue the carriage
from its imminent peril, as being the only means
of getting my lame friend to the Refuge, a quarter
of a mile distant.</p>

<p>I therefore detached the string of mules from
those at the wheel&mdash;the latter holding on like
grim death to the carriage during the necessary
delay&mdash;then, taking three from the string of single
mules (there was no room for more on the road),
I fastened their rope-traces round the body of
the carriage, when, all being ready, a few grunts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
from the driver made them spring across the
track and land the carriage on its side in the
road. The two mules who had held on so
resolutely came over also, and, from the draught
becoming irregular, some confusion occurred;
chiefly owing to the stupidity of the driver, who
uttered in the same breath &ldquo;Wo-a-a-h!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;U-u-u-p!&rdquo; one being the word to stop, the
other to proceed. All this occurred in the midst
of heavy blinding clouds of snow, covering every
article which impeded its course.</p>

<p>Having arrested the carriage in its downward
course, the next thing was to get it on its perpendicular;
and this we accomplished with the
assistance of the same three mules which had
capsized it. Right glad was I to replace my
poor friend in his seat. He had been suffering
agony from cold whilst sitting in the snow,
incapable, through his accident, to render me the
least assistance. Finally, I collected such of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
traps as could be recovered from the snow, and,
having hitched on the string anew, proceeded
cautiously to the Refuge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This being the first heavy fall of snow of
the winter, our arrival was rather a surprise,
and found the inhabitants somewhat unprepared.
It was the work, however, but of a few minutes
to kindle an enormous wood fire, in front of
which we soon became dry and warm.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The inmates of the Refuge, who were of the
peasant class, overwhelmed us with simple attentions.
The supply of provisions was small
and presented no great variety, comprising
chiefly black bread, macaroni, dry beans, and
hard sausages, with a little oil.</p>

<p>The first night spent at the Refuge was
amusing from its novelty, and as we all slept
in the same apartment with the Piedmontese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
family, we had to make ourselves at home as
best we could. One of the daughters, a girl of
sixteen, had served a campaign in London with
a tambourine as an accompaniment to her own
voice and her brother&rsquo;s barrel-organ. The boy
was about twelve, with very black eyes and a
long Italian chin. When addressed, his countenance
relaxed into a beseeching smile, showing
a set of the whitest teeth, thrusting forward
his half-open palm, and jerking his long forelock
with the other hand, he whimpered out: &ldquo;<i>Carità,
signori, si vi piaci. Signori, pauvre geen-peeg.</i>&rdquo;
He had carried a guinea-pig on the top of his
organ when in England, but all their property
had been confiscated for arrears of rent, and
they were sent home as paupers by the Italian
consul.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What was our horror when on the following
morning we looked out upon mountains of snow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
without the slightest indication of any track.
Our prospect of being able to proceed was
doubtful enough. Both our host and the muleteer
returned from reconnoitring with hopeless
faces. Snow had been falling all night, and,
until a track had been cleared, the road was
quite impassable even for mules without a vehicle,
and we were unfortunately so near the summit
as to be beyond communication with either base.
There was nothing for it but to remain where
we were, and to be thankful for our escape.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prospect of passing another night in these
wretched quarters was not exhilarating; but my
lame friend was so unequal to any exertion, that
I did not dare (in opposition to the opinions of
the driver and the padrone) to make any attempt
to proceed. Moreover, we were getting more
accustomed to the smell of oil and garlic, with
which the whole atmosphere of the Refuge was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
impregnated. The surprise and confusion consequent
upon our arrival had worn off; and we
had fallen into our places more as members of
the family than strangers.</p>

<p>As the second evening advanced, I took my
last look of the snowy world, and found it dismal
in the extreme. The sheds and yard in which the
mules were picketed were barricaded against
attack from the wolves which infest these Alpine
ridges, two lamps being hung at either entrance
as the best safeguard against these ferocious
marauders, who become so bold during the winter
months, as to carry away goats and sheep from
beneath the very roofs of inhabited dwellings.</p>

<p>I now turned my attention to the prospects
for the night; and having arranged a comfortable
shake-down with the cushions of the carriage, I
stretched myself on a bench; where our late
exposure to the cold, added to the anxiety of the
circumstances, aided and encouraged by the heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
of a superb fire composed of roots and peat, lulled
me into a profound sleep.</p>

<p>During this state of unconsciousness I travelled
over miles of snow, the surface being sufficiently
hard to carry my horses and sleigh without
perforating it. I saw myriads of wolves and bears,
which grinned and snarled at me as I passed, but
did not interrupt my progress; on the contrary,
they encouraged me by their gestures to proceed,
always pointing onwards. It would have been
well for me if I had disregarded their direction, as
I flew on, urging my horses to a gallop, always
ascending the hill, though I did not appear to get
any higher; at length I turned upon the trackless
height, out of consideration for my horses; and
was about to descend into a ravine, when I found
myself surrounded by hundreds of savages engaged
in hot warfare. I was in the thick of the fight.</p>

<p>No firearms, no smoke; but a great deal of
yelling and screaming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>I was surrounded by both sides; and though
my appearance upon the field caused a momentary
truce, hostilities were soon resumed, and I was
struck in the chest by an arrow&mdash;which, being
barbed, could not be extricated. I made great
efforts to protect my lame friend from being
trampled upon in the <i>mêlée</i>. No more violence
was offered, and I hoped, from the more subdued
tones of the contending warriors, that negotiations
for a peaceful solution of the strife&mdash;whatever it
might be&mdash;were taking the place of the fight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I tried to persuade myself that I had been
dreaming, and that the barbed arrow in my breast
was the effect of the hard savoyard upon which
I had supped; but there was the reality. There
was my poor friend imploring me to keep them
off his broken limb. There were the savages,
yelling and disputing in unknown languages,
covered by their shields, and encased in armour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
which looked like straw bands bound round their
legs to the knee.</p>

<p>The reader will have guessed the solution;
and he is right. The savoyard and black bread
upon which I supped, succeeded by the heavy
sleep which was induced by the roaring fire,
occasioned the dream which supplies the story.
Late in the night the Refuge was invaded by a
crowd of Piedmontese peasants, who are engaged
to cut passes in the snow to enable the traffic to
be carried on. These gangs are hired without
reference to character or conduct; consequently,
when the first deep snow of the winter occurs,
it brings together many opposite feuds and factions,
who take this opportunity of settling, either by
stiletto or by words and wrangling, all existing
differences.</p>

<p>Finding the snow not sufficiently settled to
proceed with their operations, they had sought
the nearest refuge to their work to await the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
lulling of the storm, their huge wooden shovels
slung across their shoulders, and the straw bands
round their legs doing duty for the shields and
armour of the contending savages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The remainder of the night was passed in a
dense cloud of the smoke of bad tobacco, mingled
with the vapours arising from our damp visitors.</p>

<p>I could not in common humanity leave my
disabled comrade to the rough treatment of this
army of road-cleaners, or I should have much
preferred the outside elements, with all their
severity, to the offensive atmosphere of the Refuge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The dawn of day, however, brought with it a
slight change in the direction of the wind, which
had very much abated in its violence, and this
enabled the men of the wooden shovels to clear
out and continue their work. It was not till
late on the following morning that the track had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
been sufficiently worked out for us to proceed.
We then attached our mules to a sleigh and
crawled to the summit, where we left our long
team and proceeded, with one pair of horses, to
descend the mountain.</p>

<p>When the snow has fallen in sufficient
quantities to cover the road, carriages on wheels
are abandoned, and the traffic is carried on by
means of sleighs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The descent is performed in a marvellously
short time, the horses being very clever, and the
driver having sufficient nerve to let them use
their own discretion as to pace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The railway terminus at St. Jean de Maurienne
affording a good buffet, we were right glad of an
opportunity of refreshing our exhausted systems
with some civilised food, and, having done so,
took the train to Paris.</p>

<p class="summary">Right as the mail&mdash;Proprietors and contractors&mdash;Guards and
coachmen&mdash;A cold foot-bath&mdash;A lawyer nonsuited&mdash;Old
Mac&mdash;The Spectre squire&mdash;An unsolved mystery.</p>

<div class="drop">&ldquo;<img src="images/drop_r.png" width="78" height="80" alt="R" /></div>
<p class="afterdrop"><span class="uc"><span class="hide">&ldquo;R</span>ight</span> as the mail,&rdquo; is an expression which
even now conveys an impression of
perfection; and what indeed could
have been more thoroughly adapted to the work
for which it was designed than the old English
mail? There was an air of solidity and importance
about the royal mail to which everything gave
way. The origin of the term &ldquo;Right as the
Mail,&rdquo; arose more from the fact that the guards
(Government servants) were supplied with chronometers
which were compared daily at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
General Post Office, and consequently dictated
the correct time to all the clocks and watches
down the road.</p>

<p>As some of my younger readers may not have
seen a stage-coach, it may be well to describe one.
The weight was about one ton. It was painted
red, having a royal coat-of-arms on the panel of
the door. It was constructed to carry four
inside and four out, having a bag or basket for
luggage, the roof being reserved for heavy mail-bags.
A round seat behind, covered with a
skin, was for the guard, pockets for pistols being
placed on either side.</p>

<p>Contracts for horsing the mails did not often
change hands, though tenders were formally
invited every year.</p>

<p>Nelson, Shearman, and Chaplin were amongst
the largest contractors. The latter had at one
time one thousand seven hundred horses employed
in coaching. A story is told of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
which proves that, whilst he was a kind and
considerate master, he always kept his weather
eye open. He used to dine with his coachmen
once every year, when one of his toasts
was &ldquo;Success to shouldering!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> adding: &ldquo;But
let me catch <i>you</i> at it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One great source of profit to a mail was
the oil which was allowed by the General Post
Office. A mail was always expected to have
its lamps lighted after sunset, moonlight or not,
consequently the amount of oil &ldquo;shouldered,&rdquo;
or charged for, though not used, was considerable.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/i_151-large.jpg"><img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="600" height="287" alt="THE ROYAL MAIL." /></a>
</div>

<p>It was a beautiful sight to see the mails
on the King&rsquo;s birthday assembled at the General
Post Office&mdash;the men all dressed in new liveries,
and in most cases with new harness; the horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
decorated with bouquets of flowers&mdash;making a
promenade through the principal streets in the
west of London.</p>

<p>This parade did not in any way interfere
with the regular work, and nearly all the night
mails assembled at the General Post Office at
eight o&rsquo;clock to receive their bags. Some of
the Western and Southern mails were met by
a mail-cart with their bags at their own booking
offices in the West-end. The fastest mail
out of London was the &ldquo;Devonport,&rdquo; commonly
called the &ldquo;Quicksilver;&rdquo; and who that ever
saw can forget it, with its four chestnuts,
driven by Charles Ward, leaving the White
Horse Cellars at half-past eight!</p>

<p>How it rattled through Piccadilly! passing
all the other mails, eight in number, and
arriving first at Hounslow, where they all changed
horses.</p>

<p>Ward drove on to Bagshot, returning with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the up-mail about three <span class="small">A.M.</span>; sixty miles a-night,
and this for seven years.</p>

<p>Another coachman, Bill Harbridge, to whom
I have already referred in these pages, drove
the &ldquo;Manchester&rdquo; mail for two years out of
London, performing one hundred miles a-night;
fifty miles down and fifty miles up. I have
his own authority for saying that he used to
take as much as fourteen pounds to sixteen
pounds a-week in fees, the Manchester merchants
used to pay so well. The General Post Office
also allowed him two guineas a-week. He
was another instance of the total want of
prudence, unfortunately so common to his class,
and died in the workhouse.</p>

<p>Although coachmen and guards, when coaching
was in its zenith, were in receipt of comfortable
incomes, it is very rare that an instance
is found of their having provided for a rainy
day, and still more rare to find any instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
of their having taken service in any railway
establishment.</p>

<p>Many of the coaches, when there was not too
much opposition, would earn from five pounds to
six pounds a-mile per month. If corn and
beans were not unusually high, three pounds a
mile was said to pay.</p>

<p>The profits of a coach were divided monthly,
and all outgoings disbursed&mdash;the mails having
considerable advantage from their having neither
duty nor gates to pay. One of the largest sources
of revenue was derived from the booking of parcels,
each article being charged twopence. Articles of
value were registered, and paid according to the
amount insured.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some years ago I was driving a fast coach in
the north of England, when a singular surprise
occurred to me.</p>

<p>It was sometimes the custom to give the mail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
teams a rest, by letting them run over a longer
stage, where they were not expected to go so fast
as the mail was timed. This change had been
made, on the occasion of which I write, from
Barnby Moor.</p>

<p>We rattled along over the eight miles of ground
allotted to the mail stage, and here was their
natural stop. No remark had been made to me
either by the coachman or by the proprietor (who
happened to be upon the coach), and who then
cautioned me that the horses would want to run up
to the place where the mail pulled up to change.
I took precautionary measures accordingly, in order
to get them by it. I had succeeded (as I thought)
admirably, and, having passed the place, was
looking round rather with a view of inviting a
compliment from the professional coachman who
was sitting behind me, when, all at once, as if
shot out of a gun, the whole team bolted out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the road, and we found ourselves in the middle of
a deep horsepond.</p>

<p>This team was accustomed, when taken out of
the mail, to be ridden at once into the pond to
be washed. They had run cheerfully past their
stable, but the temptation of the horsepond was
irresistible, so in they went.</p>

<p>There were two elderly ladies inside the
coach, who screamed out loudly for help and a
lifeboat.</p>

<p>It was one of those deep roadside ponds, with
a white rail round it; plenty of room to get in,
but very little room to get out. Here we were
planted, water up to the axles, inside full, and the
team, in the greatest confusion; although each
horse looked satisfied that he had done the right
thing, and was in no particular hurry to get
out.</p>

<p>After much splashing and pawing we got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
leaders off, and, by backing her on the lock, I
got the coach safely ashore; not, however, before
the old ladies had got a thorough ducking.</p>

<p>I superintended personally the administration
of two glasses of hot brandy-and-water to each
of the ladies who had been involuntarily subjected
to a cold foot-bath.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was so much opposition, in the days of
which I am writing&mdash;forty years ago&mdash;that coach
proprietors were only too anxious to make reparation
in the most liberal manner for any little inconvenience
to which passengers might be accidentally
exposed. In this case the proprietor was present,
and would readily have complied with any
reasonable wish expressed by the passengers.</p>

<p>Modesty almost forbids me to mention here
that, when the coach was ready to start, I was
requested by the proprietor to continue to drive;
which, to an amateur, and a young amateur, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
no small compliment&mdash;evidently showing that
our immersion in the horsepond had not been
caused by any want of skill or experience on my
part.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When opposition was at its height in England,
every device was resorted to in order to render
one coach more popular than another. Advertising
was carried to a very great extent, and
squibs were unreservedly circulated in order to
lower the prestige of the contending parties. As,
for instance, notice was given that a certain coach
had reduced its rate for carrying pigs and poultry;
no charge would be made for children under
twelve, provided they sat upon the knees of their
parents, or those of some other passenger; great
care was taken that &ldquo;hospital linen&rdquo; should be
stowed <i>inside</i>.</p>

<p>Although opposition between the coaches was
carried to great extremes, it never got to quite so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
high a pitch as amongst the postmasters, amongst
whom within the last fifty years the emulation was
so rife upon the North Road that the horses of a
private carriage would be forcibly taken off and
a fresh pair attached at the Red Lion at Barnet,
and the next stage to St. Albans (nine miles)
performed without charge, in order to prevent
the &ldquo;turn&rdquo; from going to the White Hart, where
the traveller might have partaken of a sandwich
and a glass of sherry gratis.</p>

<p>This state of things could not last long,
especially as in its next phase it entailed the
hiring of a staff of fighting-men to secure the
employment of the Red Lion horses.</p>

<p>Matters having arrived at such a pitch as to
cause a free fight in the highroad whenever a
posting job hove in sight, the local authorities
were obliged to interfere, and Messrs. Newman
and Bryant, the landlords of the two hotels, were
bound over to keep the peace and abide by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
regular tariff of one shilling and threepence a
mile, and threepence the postboy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The guard of the mail, apart from his being
a certificated newsmonger, was held in great respect
by the idlers who collected to see the mail change
in every town or village through which he passed.
What he said was absolute, there was no time
for argument, and the few words which he
addressed to the customary group afforded matter
for the smoking-room for a whole evening. Many
trifling incidents and occurrences, by the time
they had passed through a jury of gin-and-water
and churchwardens, were distorted into the most
terrible and tragic facts.</p>

<p>Every road has its legend, and guards of the
coaches make stock-in-trade of the ghosts and
supernatural appearances as it suits their opportunity.
A tale may be so often repeated that,
however sceptical the narrator is at first, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
becomes quite ready to vouch for the whole truth
of it on more intimate acquaintance.</p>

<p>Some ghosts are more profitable than others,
their feats and appearances being varied in
character.</p>

<p>An old mail guard, who had served the
Government in that capacity for forty years, and
who was in receipt of a pension of eighty
pounds per annum, was in the habit of coming
to London during the summer season and taking
service on one of the &ldquo;Revival&rdquo; coaches; he
rode behind me for three seasons to Rochester,
and two to Brighton, and behind Chandos Pole,
upon that road, for many more. His anecdotes
were inexhaustible; he recounted the most incredible
catalogue of accidents, attacks, delays, impediments
to the mails he had been on, in all of
which he had played the hero&rsquo;s part. His quixotic
triumphs over every sort of difficulty were most
amusing, and not without result, as I know, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
one occasion, he declined a Saturday journey
behind me to Brighton. He had one ghost only
upon this road, whose appearances, however,
were so innocent and evident that he was obliged
to draw largely upon his imagination, and borrow
matter from other goblins, in order to make him
sufficiently sensational. I give the naked tale,
and leave the garnishing of &ldquo;Old Mac&rdquo; to the
imagination of my readers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Upon the side of the highroad to Brighton, not
a hundred miles from Handcross, there stands, in
its own ornamental grounds, one of those very
picturesque residences which is neither a villa
nor a mansion, though it combined the modesty
of the one with the importance of the other.
The house was sufficiently retired from the road
to admit of a spacious lawn studded with ornamental
trees of considerable size, which gave the
whole thing a park-like appearance, and, standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
as it did upon an eminence, presented a generally
picturesque appearance.</p>

<p>The owner of this property was a gentleman
of independent means, and of rather eccentric
habits. He resided all the year round at &mdash;&mdash;,
never went into society, and never entertained
friends at home.</p>

<p>Many years were passed in the quiet routine
of everyday life; nothing remarkable occurred
except that the owner was absent daily for
several hours, and could not be induced to give
any explanation of whither he went, or otherwise
account for his absence. When closely questioned
by his wife, he used to evade the subject, and
implore her not to press her inquiry upon him,
as, if he were to disclose the secret, he might
never be allowed to return.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Time went on, and the anxiety (to say nothing
of the curiosity) of the wife to solve this mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
absence and the secrecy it involved, induced her
to communicate with a private inquiry office
to solve it.</p>

<p>This step was no sooner taken than an end
was put to all local evidence, by the sudden
disappearance of the gentleman, without leaving
the slightest clue to his whereabouts. Coverts
were searched, ponds dragged, rewards offered, all
in vain. No word was ever heard from that day
to this of the missing gentleman. The wife
continued to live at &mdash;&mdash; until her death, which
occurred several years after the mysterious disappearance
of her husband. And, during these
years, the room which had been occupied by the
gentleman, upon the ground-floor (window opening
upon the lawn) was still visited on occasions by
an apparition, who frequently changed his hat and
gloves, leaving old ones behind, and taking those
which were always neatly brushed and laid out
for his use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a broad quick-set hedge, cut square
upon the top, separating the premises from the
highroad, and, walking upon this hedge, may be
seen on almost any night the &ldquo;Spectre Squire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The apparition of the squire was not seen
only by a few of the neighbours, but sceptics
came from long distances, and returned satisfied
that they had seen (and some that they had
conversed with) the phantom.</p>

<p>An old man who kept a turnpike-gate, not
a quarter of a mile from the haunted residence,
assured me that he had seen him, night after
night, and described it as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d a-come in, and was sitting in the porch
doorway, about <i>leben</i> o&rsquo;clock, as fur as I remember.
My old &rsquo;oman she kep&rsquo; &rsquo;ollering out to me:
&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you ope&rsquo; the gate; there&rsquo;s a funeral
a-coming?&rsquo; I thought she was mazed. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
nobody there,&rsquo; says I. Well, whilst I was there
I could see nothing, but the gate took and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
swung open of itself, and come back on the
bolt, and this it did four or five times! I took
and I got up and put the chain on the gate
and locked it. Oh dear, oh dear! Down he
come, and he was that angry! He walked
backwards and forwards through the gate, right
through the middle&mdash;that never stopped him a
minute!</p>

<p>&rdquo;Since that I&rsquo;ve a-seed him scores of times
doing the same thing, and he takes no notice of
me, only scowling-like.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I chain and lock the gate o&rsquo; nights, but I
always find it open in the morning; and I can&rsquo;t
tell how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was one of the best-conducted ghosts I
have come across; as, apart from scaring the
villagers by his midnight rambles, he bore the
best of characters in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This house and premises to this day share the
fate of others which have fallen into the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of unexplained tenants, and are subject to visits
from supernatural agents.</p>

<p>Strange noises are heard; windows, which
were barred and fastened overnight, are found
open in the morning. Servants will not remain
in the situation, and do not like to explain the
cause of their wishing to leave. The turnpike-house
is pulled down, as no one could be found to
inhabit it.</p>

manner as in France&mdash;three at wheel, and any
number in pairs before them, as the nature of
the road may require. The travelling pace is
about eight English miles per hour, and to this
they adhere. The length of the posts, or stages,
makes a journey more tedious than it would otherwise
be, as it always conveys the impression that
the last four or five miles of the sixteen or
eighteen has to be performed by jaded cattle,
which must use them up more quickly, in the
long run, than letting them work in more reasonable
distances. If economy be the object, it must
certainly be negatived in the end by the last
four or five miles which are tacked on to every

<p>The conductor, or guard, goes through the

consist of open britzskas and landaus, with pairs
of horses, which are of a very good class. The
drivers are very respectable men, and excellent
coachmen. They drive very fast, and, though the
streets are narrow and tortuous, collisions are very
rare. There are also close carriages (broughams)
with one horse or a pair, the former being
called <i>coupés</i>, and not held in much favour with
the <i>élite</i>.</p>

<p>The tariff is not excessive, and a wrangle
is rarely heard.</p>

<p>With reference to private equipages, although
they imitate as much as possible the English
style, they invariably fail in some little particular,
which, to an English critic, stamps the
turn-out as continental. For instance, the
coachman sits low, with his knees bent, having
one rein in each hand; the horses are so
coupled that their heads touch each other; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
pole-pieces are so tight as to destroy any
action which the horses might otherwise display.</p>

<p>Some years ago I made the acquaintance of
a noble prince in Hungary, who owned a large
stud of horses of all descriptions&mdash;racers, hunters,
harness-horses, and hacks. He invited me to
stay with him during the race-week at Vienna,
asking me at the same time if I would drive
his drag each day to the course, assuring me
that it was appointed quite in the English
style, and that I should feel myself entirely at
home.</p>

<p>The first day of the meeting having arrived,
my host introduced me to various other noble
persons, descanting loudly, as I could not avoid
hearing, on my talent as a coachman; after
which, and having partaken of a sumptuous
<i>déjeûner</i>, we walked round to the stables.
Here my anticipations were somewhat damped,
as my noble host, pointing to a very long
low <i>char-à-banc</i>, much upon the principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
an elongated Croydon basket, exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah,
ecco a qui chè la carozza. Heer ees my drarg.&rdquo;
And, seizing a long pig-whip from the socket
of the carriage, he said: &ldquo;You can make ze
weep, ah yes?&rdquo; Suiting the action to the word, he
began cracking it backwards and forwards over his
head with wonderful proficiency, after the manner
of the French postilions. My heart sank within
me; if this was expected of me, I felt I
should signally fail&mdash;I who had been brought
up to learn that to <i>hear</i> the whip at all was
a fault. To be expected to flourish out of the
courtyard with a succession of reports like an
eighteen-pounder, was rather too severe a test
of my knowledge of &ldquo;making ze weep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After walking round the stables, which were
very complete and in fine order, the team was
brought out. It was composed of four Hungarian
horses with very long manes and tails, smacking
rather of the circus than the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not at all approve of the way in which
they were being strung together, but an English
stud-groom in the prince&rsquo;s service advised my
making no alteration &ldquo;at present,&rdquo; as they had
always been driven in that way, and they could
be very awkward if they liked.</p>

<p>All being ready, and the party having taken
their seats, I took mine, and found myself&mdash;with
a mere apology for a footboard&mdash;seated pretty
nearly on a level with the wheelers&rsquo; backs.</p>

<p>The prince, who had continued to &ldquo;make ze
weep&rdquo; (albeit of this the animals took not the
slightest notice), now handed it to me, and we
started, or rather the whole affair went jumping
out of the courtyard in a succession of terrible
bounds. The horses were, however, very highly
bitted, and I had no difficulty in holding them in
on our passage through the town; but, when we
got to the open &ldquo;prater,&rdquo; they became very restless
and impatient, a phenomenon explained in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
whisper from my host: &ldquo;Heer I make ze gallop.
You not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon this I slacked my hand, and they went
away like four demons; dashing past everything
on the road at the rate of fifty miles an hour!</p>

<p>The prince, who expressed his surprise that
I had not &ldquo;knocked&rdquo; anything in our wild
career, was less astonished than myself, especially
as when, nearing the course, the track became
crowded with every description of vehicle, while
the rules of the road were entirely set at
defiance!</p>

<p>We managed, however, to reach the grandstand
in safety. It was a brilliant day, and
the glowing colours of female costume, from the
royal family downwards, produced a magnificent
effect.</p>

<p>But if the colours worn by the ladies were
dazzling and gorgeous, what shall we say of the
hues selected for the silk jackets of the gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
riders, who, in order to proclaim to the multitude
the part they were about to take, hovered about
amongst the crowd, like tropical butterflies who
had lost their way? Indeed, so much importance
is attached to the privilege of sporting silk, that it
is no uncommon thing for a noble owner to carry a
stone over his weight, in order to display jacket
and boots on the course, rather than &ldquo;give a leg
up&rdquo; to a lighter man.</p>

<p>The events of the day were contended for
principally by gentlemen &ldquo;jocks;&rdquo; and bets of
a few guldens produced as much interest as if
thousands of pounds had been staked.</p>

<p>After passing an agreeable day (the larger
portion of which was occupied in getting the
amateur jocks to the post) I proceeded to find my
team; and took a sly opportunity of making many
alterations in the <i>attelage</i>, giving them all more
room in their couplings and in their pole-pieces,
middle bar instead of lower, and cheek to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
I thought would bear it, buckling the traces (as
near as I could) at even lengths, slacking all the
curbs, and lengthening some of the head-stalls.
The effect was marvellous; instead of the wild
impetuous team I had brought up from the city,
I had now four horses working evenly and
pleasantly together, and, after the first quarter
of a mile, not pulling an ounce more than they
ought. Here let me repeat the maxim: &ldquo;A
team properly put together is half driven.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="summary">North-country fairs&mdash;An untrained foxhunter&mdash;Tempted
again&mdash;Extraordinary memory of the horse&mdash;Satisfactory
results from a Latch-key.</p>

<div class="drop"><img src="images/drop_i2.png" width="80" height="79" alt="I" /></div>
<p class="afterdrop"><span class="uc"><span class="hide">I</span>n</span> former chapters I have spoken of
coachmen and guards, both in the
heyday and afternoon of their career&mdash;then,
once qualified for this line of life, seldom
exhibiting an inclination to change. But let me
now descend to the coach <i>horse</i>. In the good
old coaching days, so great was the demand, that
breeders were found who devoted themselves to
a class of animal calculated for coach work and
little else. There was an understood price, and
buyers for the contractors attended the North-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>country
fairs and made their selection&mdash;twenty,
fifty, or eighty horses, as required&mdash;the individual
price never being referred to during the deal,
so long as the average was not exceeded.</p>

<p>Seasoned horses were more valuable to proprietors
than green uneducated colts from the
fair; consequently, many opportunities were
afforded for &ldquo;chops&rdquo; equally advantageous to
both parties. An old hunter (old, not so much
with reference to his years, as because he had
been thus employed) made an admirable teamster.
Horses with a blemish, or perhaps from
some caprice of their owners, were often drafted
while in their zenith, and those who were fortunate
enough to pick them up, purchased with them
some months (if not years) of good keep and
condition, which could not be too highly appreciated.
Condition means time; and nothing but
time can effectually produce it. The power of
a horse may be doubled by the condition of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
frame, as it may be reduced by mismanagement
and low keep to half its natural strength.</p>

<p>A large breeder in the North of England, a
fine specimen of the old English yeoman, whom
I visited some years ago, remarked to me:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I send all my colts, at two years old, to
plough. They may play with it or they may
work, just as they please. They are only out
from eleven to three. It makes them temperate,
accustoms them to be handled, and develops
their muscles. I have bred some high-priced
ones, and all have been served the same.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In fifty-five examples of this treatment I
have never known a single instance of harm arising
from it. This horse which I am now riding&rdquo; (and
he called my attention to a very clever-looking
black-brown gelding, about fifteen hands three
inches) &ldquo;has worked on-and-off on this farm for
twenty-three years. I have been tempted to sell
him four different times, but he has always come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
back to me. We nearly lost each other the last
time, but, by a strange accident, I recovered
him.</p>

<p>&rdquo;I was on the coach, going to Doncaster, and
when we changed horses at &mdash;&mdash; I noticed that
one of them began pawing and neighing, appearing
much excited. The horsekeeper reproved him,
and led him into his place at the wheel. Having
taken my seat on the box with the coachman, I
observed that the animal was troubled by the
fretfulness of his near-side wheeler. He jumped,
backed, and shied to such a degree as to induce
me to remark to the coachman that he had a
fresh one there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, not fresh,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had
him here these ten months, and a better I never
drove. He never played this game before.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where does he come from?&rsquo; I asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I heard the governor say from Cornwall,
but he bought him at Bristol,&rsquo; said the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Up to this moment every action, every
movement, had so entirely reminded me of my
friend Latch-key, that I could almost have sworn
to his identity. But how he could have come
out of Cornwall to be sold at Bristol puzzled
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On arriving at the end of the stage, however,
my suspicions were confirmed. This was my old
friend and favourite, Latch-key, and although we
had been separated for more than two years, he
remembered me better than I did him, and seemed
anxious to renew all the pettings and caresses
which used to pass between us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not to weary my reader with a history of
the whole life of this horse, there is still something
so remarkable in the fact of a man having bred
a horse, and then purchased him four different
times, that I may be forgiven for giving a slight
sketch of his antecedents&mdash;as far as they could be
traced by my host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Foaled in 1828. The dam, being blind, lost
her way, fell into a ditch, and was fatally injured.
The foal was reared by hand, chiefly upon ass&rsquo;s
milk. Being a privileged member of the farmyard
group, he became the constant companion of his
foster-brother, the foal of the mare donkey which
had supplied all his wants. These two grazed in
the orchard, frolicked in the park, and were
always to be found near the house together. The
young ass was an adept at opening gates, and
the colt had acquired a knowledge of the art to
such perfection that no fastening short of a chain
and padlock could keep him in. Thence he acquired
the sobriquet of Latch-key.</p>

<p>&rdquo;At the age of two years he went to plough
with other colts of his own age. The monotony
of this work did not suit him, and hearing the
hounds one day running at a short distance
from his work, he was seized with a sudden determination
to follow them, and after a severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
and protracted kicking-match, having knocked
two partners out of time, made his escape.
Away he went, with part of his chains and a
spreading-bar still hanging to him. These encumbrances
caused him some awkward falls to
begin with, which only served to increase the
amusement he afforded to the field, as he quickly
righted himself and resumed his place in the
front rank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The country was stiff and the field getting
select when Latch-key joined the cry. The hounds
had got a good straight-necked fox before them,
and there was a rattling scent&mdash;one of those days
when the only way to live with them was by
galloping from parish to parish, and then only
to find they were two fields before you. But I
am digressing, and it is quite necessary to go
straight in such an affair as I am describing.
Taking every fence as it came, in company with
the foremost riders, Latch-key held his own, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
it was not till, at the end of forty-five minutes,
the gallant fox saved his brush by getting into
a rabbit-hole, that, with heaving flanks, distended
nostrils, and dripping with perspiration, he received
the commendations of the field as they
came up on the line.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Bravo, young &rsquo;un! I should like to have
you at five years old.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where does he come from?&rsquo; etc. etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fox had brought them over a distance
of nine miles as the crow flies, and few witnessed
the finish.</p>

<p>&rdquo;&lsquo;Catch that cart-colt, and take him down
to the farmhouse. They may know him, my lad.
And here is a pot of beer for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All good fox-hunters are Good Samaritans,
and in this case the life of what proved afterwards
to be a most valuable animal was saved by the
charitable attention of the gentlemen in scarlet.
It was found, when the yokel went up to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
to lead him away, that he was standing in a pool
of blood, having staked himself severely in the
chest. If the wound had not been plugged and
promptly attended to, the colt&rsquo;s first day&rsquo;s hunting
would have been his last.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Latch-key remained in the quarters he had
accidentally dropped into until he was well enough
to travel, when he returned to his native home.
In addition to a very severe stake, he was otherwise
much scarred by the broken plough-harness,
and consequently required careful nursing to
restore him to health and soundness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the next two years he was kept apart
from other young stock, and was constantly fed
and petted by the farmer and his family. At
the beginning of the fifth year, when he had
been broken and was in his best looks, a dealer
from London came down and bought him for a
handsome sum.</p>

<p>&rdquo;When he had been sufficiently prepared for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
London show he was sold to a gentleman in
Berkshire, who hunted him four seasons, and
then, finding he did not like harness, sold him
for a reduced price at Tattersall&rsquo;s, and he fell into
the hands of a coper, who, finding he would
not harness, chopped him away to a salesman.
The latter sent him, with several others, to Hull,
to be shipped for St. Petersburg. He was on
the point of being embarked, when my son, who
happened to be at Hull at the time, recognised
and, well knowing his intrinsic value, bought him
for double the contract price. This was in 1838.
He had not been at home a week when he was
sold to a cavalry officer, who found him a first-class
hunter, and did not regret having given me
two hundred guineas for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He changed hands several times in the regiment,
at various prices, and was finally sold to
a young squire, whose effects came to the hammer
under the superintendence of the sheriff, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
York. At this sale I purchased Latch-key for
thirty-seven guineas, and took him for my own
riding.</p>

<p>&rdquo;Although much attached to the horse, a very
good offer tempted me once more to part with
him, in order to effect the sale of several others
which had been selected, provided he were
thrown in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time he went to London again, and
was broken to harness, and sold to a noble
lord, who took him to Edinburgh. Here he
met with an accident through collision with a
tradesman&rsquo;s cart, which disfigured and lamed
him for a considerable time. Whilst under
treatment of a veterinary surgeon, an intimate
friend of mine, and belonging to my neighbourhood,
finding the horse would be sold for
&lsquo;a song,&rsquo; purchased him for me, and sent
him home, where he soon recovered, and resumed
his place as my hack. This was in the year 1845.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>&rdquo;I continued to ride him for several years,
until on one eventful day I was induced once
more to throw him in with a string I was
selling to a London dealer; and from that
time we never set eyes on each other till our
mutual recognition in the coach at &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is another instance of the extraordinary
memory possessed by horses, and a convincing
proof that they are as prone to
remember kindness and good treatment as they
do punishment and discomfort.</p>

<p>&rdquo;After this, I lost no time in purchasing
my old friend from the proprietors of the coach,
which I did for the reasonable sum of thirty-five
guineas. When grazing in the meadows
near the highroad, he listens for the horn, and
always trots cheerfully down to the gate to
see the coach pass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that this horse returned to me, in his
sales and purchases in the course of twenty-two
years, a net sum of two hundred and
ninety-three pounds! We make no mystery as
to his age, since money would no longer buy
him; but during his career as a marketable
animal, Latch-key chanced to be never more
than &lsquo;eight years old!&rsquo; He is now twenty-seven,

confirmed it with a whinny, accompanied, however,
by a significant shake of his head, which
might have implied: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust you,
even <i>now</i>, if a good offer came in your way!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="uc"><span class="hide">T</span>he</span> Coach and Horses was the sign of
a small roadside inn in North Wales,
beautifully situated, as far as scenery
and landscape were concerned, but as the house
was built upon the steepest part of a severe hill,
it was as difficult to stop in descending as it
was inviting to &ldquo;pull-up&rdquo; in the ascent.</p>

<p>The house was kept by an old coachman,
whose family consisted of his wife, daughter, and
son, a boy twelve years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man&rsquo;s knowledge of the requirements
necessary to make both man and horse comfortable,
acquired for him a just reputation, and
tourists (especially with their own horses) frequently
made the Coach and Horses their headquarters
from which to make expeditions into
the country. Two fast coaches changed horses,
up and down, daily, serving as antidotes to the
usual dulness of a country inn.</p>

<p>Some years ago I was making a &ldquo;drag-tour&rdquo;
through that part of the country, and, one of
my wheelers having picked up a nail, I was
compelled to halt for some days at the Coach and
Horses. At any other time I should have enjoyed
some fishing, but the season had closed. I passed,
the time in rambling amongst the magnificent
scenery which the country afforded, devoting my
attention to the objects of natural history with
which it abounds, and taking advantage of the
coaches for a lift home when I exceeded my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
distance. On one of these occasions I had been
led far into the wildest part of the hills in
endeavouring to watch a dispute between a
kestrel and a raven, which interested me so
much that I was quite unmindful of time,
distance, or direction, and found myself at dusk
completely lost. No landmark, no guide of any
description to suggest my course. I had come
out &ldquo;down wind,&rdquo; but the wind may have
changed! There was the sunset, <i>et voilà tout</i>.</p>

<p>A thick fog now began to rise, entirely concealing
every trace of outline.</p>

<p>To light a pipe and sit down upon a rock
to consider what was to be done, was all that
remained to me.</p>

<p>The darkness increased rapidly, and, with the
rising vapour, soon rendered it impossible to see
a yard in advance. The situation was grave.
I knew I was in the neighbourhood of steep
declivities, and therefore decided upon remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
where I was till the fog lifted and there was
more light.</p>

<p>The time passed heavily, and the scene would
have been gloomy in the extreme, if the busy
lights of the Jack-o&rsquo;-lanterns had not kept
me constantly on the <i>qui vive</i>. These singular
visitors appeared to venture nearer and nearer to
my sheltering rock and endeavour to entice me
to follow them, bounding and dancing down the
hill before me, and joining a host of other lights
which appeared to be holding high revel in the
valley beneath.</p>

<p>The mist thickened into a drizzling rain,
which made the darkness even darker, and
caused my weird companions to flit about with
increased activity. So natural were these appearances
that I could scarcely refrain from following
one larger light which appeared to be sent forward
to escort me, venturing each time nearer and
nearer to my stony refuge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>If any of my readers have involuntarily passed
a night upon a Welsh mountain, they will know
what mingled distress and pleasure the dawn
produces&mdash;distress, because, however cold, wet,
and miserable you may have been during the
night, the dawn brings with it a change of
atmosphere which runs through your bones, and
causes your whole frame to shiver; and the waiting
for the light, intolerable pleasure, because, with
the return of glorious day, come relief and
light.</p>

<p>The longed-for light at length began to creep
amongst the boulders and the heather, and show
me once more how wisely I had decided in
remaining still, instead of attempting to feel my
way in any uncertain direction, surrounded as I
was by deep ravines and precipices.</p>

<p>Tired, wet through, and with aching bones, I
began my peregrination, and after walking some
two miles through the hills I espied a cottage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to which I directed my steps in the hope of getting
some refreshment. To my surprise and joy, I
found a woman at the cottage who was evidently
expecting some arrival. I had some difficulty in
making the woman understand that I appealed
only for a glass of milk. She spoke nothing but
Welsh, and appeared much alarmed at my visit.
If it had not been for the opportune arrival of
two men (peasants), one of whom spoke English,
I might have failed to obtain even the modest
hospitality I so much needed.</p>

<p>After some conversation, in which I described
myself and my position without reserve, we were
all, within a few minutes, supplied with an ample
bowl of hot oatmeal porridge.</p>

<p>The cottage was situated in a lonely glen,
thickly studded with brushwood, but I could discern
no road leading to it. I had made my way
across the hills, and on inquiring the distance to
the Coach and Horses, I found it was five miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Feeling that my unaccountable absence must
have given rise to some anxiety, I was eager to
depart as soon as I had finished breakfast, and
with that view had arranged with the peasant
to conduct me to the highroad. Suddenly, as
we were about to leave the cottage, the door was
rudely forced open, and two men, entering, seized
me by the collar, saying: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for
<i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve found me,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;for the good people at the Coach and Horses
must have been much distressed at my disappearance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be distressed when they hear
that you&rsquo;ve got three months for this job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mean! Why, we mean that we have been
a-watching of you all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you had made your presence known,&rdquo;
said I. &ldquo;I would have made it worth your while.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but we don&rsquo;t do business in that way.
No, no! a good catch like this for us is better
than a good catch of fish is for you. We saw
your lights a mile off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was more puzzled than ever. Except an
occasional fusee for my pipe, and the marsh-light,
I had passed the whole weary night without seeing
a light at all.</p>

<p>But on further explanation I began to comprehend
that the river-watchers had suspected
me of having been flame-poaching all night, and
followed me to the cottage.</p>

<p>I protested that I was no poacher, but a
benighted tourist who had accidentally lost his
way upon the hills, and that I could prove my
assertions if taken to the Coach and Horses.</p>

<p>All I could say was of no avail, and with a
fellow-prisoner&mdash;a peasant, now brought in&mdash;I
was marched off to Rhyadder; where, at
eleven o&rsquo;clock on the same day, we were taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
before a bench of magistrates, charged with having
&ldquo;unlawfully, by means of torches and spears,
captured salmon during the night season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An anxious night had been passed at the
Coach and Horses in consequence of my absence.
Messengers had been despatched in all directions
to inquire and search; and it was not until my
messenger arrived, requesting the landlord of the
Coach and Horses to come at once and identify
me, that the apprehensions of my friends were
allayed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To prove my innocence was by no means so
easy a task as it would appear. Two river-watchers
swore point-blank to having seen me
and my fellow-prisoner at the edge of the pool
fishing with torches, that they watched us for a
considerable time, and at daybreak followed us
to the cottage where we were apprehended.</p>

<p>The oaths of these two men, combined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
circumstantial evidence, were so strong against me
that I almost doubted whether I had been poaching
or not! My urgent declaration that I had
been sitting upon a rock all night seemed weakish;
it wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;wash.&rdquo; I overheard one of the
magistrates whisper to his neighbour something
about &ldquo;a cock-and-bull story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had well-nigh broken down in my <i>alibi</i>
when the landlord of the Coach and Horses
rushed into court. But he could only identify
me as the missing gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you pass the night?&rdquo; was the
repeated question from the Bench. I had never
found so much difficulty in accounting for myself
during a night in my life; and my assurance
that I had been benighted upon a mountain gave
rise to much merriment amongst the audience,
salmon poaching being at that time a very common
offence in Wales. On the other hand the two
river-watchers had sworn that they had followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
us, step by step, from the pool to the cottage&mdash;a
distance of two miles&mdash;and that they had never
lost sight of us. The fact proved to be that
they had followed and apprehended two men,
but the second poacher had slipped out of the
cottage when the watchers entered, and <i>I</i> had
slipped into his place!</p>

<p>My landlord of the Coach and Horses pleaded
earnestly for my acquittal, but facts are stubborn&mdash;so
are Welsh justices; and it was with the greatest
reluctance that the Bench consented to release me
on bail, to come up again for judgment in a
week, during which time further inquiry would be
made into my statement.</p>

<p>My triumphant return to the Coach and Horses
was an occasion of much rejoicing, though I believe
there are some who to this day have felt disinclined
to acquit me of all complicity in the salmon
poaching foray.</p>

<p>When the day of judgment arrived I took with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
me &ldquo;young David,&rdquo; the son of the landlord, and
sought the cottage from which I had been so
roughly taken. My disappointment was great at
finding the house closed and the door barred,
having no appearance of occupation about it. I
was turning away in despair when we heard the
bleating of a calf, which showed the place was not
altogether deserted.</p>

<p>We resolved to wait till the evening set in,
concluding that someone interested in the young
calf would respond to its pitiful appeal; nor were
we wrong in our surmise. As the evening closed
in we espied a woman in the distance, leading a
black cow towards the house. We lay in ambush
till matters were sufficiently advanced to prevent
an abrupt appearance from interrupting the
domestic arrangements, and then, taking David
to interpret for me, I asked the woman if she
remembered having seen me before.</p>

<p>Apparently much alarmed, she flew into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
rage, denouncing me in terms which, David
informed me, were anything but complimentary,
and declaring that I had betrayed her husband
and brother, and caused them to be apprehended
by the watchers. It took some time to &ldquo;moderate
the rancour&rdquo; of this lady&rsquo;s tongue, but when we
had brought her to reason, she agreed to come
forward and state in the court that I had come
to the cottage, on the morning in question, before
her husband and brother, and had not seen
them till we met at the cottage. Questioned
about her brother, she said he had sailed for
America.</p>

<p>Armed with this evidence, I presented myself
before the bench of magistrates at the appointed
time. The woman had kept faith, and was
present, although not called, for the watchers
had become a little shaken in their belief; and
inquiry having been made, and proving satis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>factory,
I was at once acquitted. Not so my
fellow-prisoner, who, this being his fourth conviction,
was sentenced to six months&rsquo; hard
labour.</p>

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="uc"><span class="hide">B</span>efore</span> the reign of King Bianconi in
Ireland, the coaching and all public
conveyances were of a most primitive
description.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> I am writing of Ireland fifty years
ago, when it was a real pleasure to have intercourse
with the peasantry; when every look was
a smile; when the hardest raps with a shillelah
were accepted as additional tokens of friendship;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
and if a few heads were broken it was looked
upon simply as part of the fun of the fair.</p>

<p>Hospitality is no word for the overflowing
welcome which was invariably extended to a
stranger, and the sincerity of the men was only
equalled by the fascination of the softer sex.
The ready repartee, the quick appreciation of
wit or satire, were ingredients which gave zest
to conversation and piquancy to a society unlike
that which may be met with in any other
country.</p>

<p>In the same degree, the peasantry, as far as
their humble means would permit, were ever
ready to display their kindly feeling towards a
stranger, no matter of what social grade.</p>

<p>As a soldier in those days I had some disagreeable
duties to perform, but these were frequently
rendered less painful by the very people
against whom these duties were directed. I allude,
for example, to &ldquo;still-hunting.&rdquo; It was the rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
in those days for the gauger, whose duty it was
to hunt up all illicit stills in the country, to make
a requisition for a party of military, to supervise
and surround the suspected spot, prevent the escape
of those concerned in the manufacture, and secure,
if possible, the worm of the still. The latter
part of the triumph was seldom achieved; a small
steel worm, which would go into a man&rsquo;s hat,
would take a party of gaugers a long night to
hunt for, and often wind up with a blank
after all.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/i_211-large.jpg"><img src="images/i_211.jpg" width="600" height="217" alt="THE PUBLIC CAR." /></a>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I was detached from the headquarters of my
regiment at the town of Ballingarry, Limerick.
I had been out as usual with my gun in the
bogs, which, in that neighbourhood, abounded
in snipe, and having dined in my snug quarters
(the lodge at the gate of the Protestant minister&rsquo;s
demesne), had just finished my tumbler of &ldquo;hot
stoppings,&rdquo; when the thump of an open palm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
against my door announced a visit from my
sergeant-major.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the gauger, sir; and he wants our
men to capture a still.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A cold frosty night outside, and a clear turf
fire within, with other pictures of comfort, did not
help to inflame my soul with military ardour in
the prospect of a still-hunt among the mountains
five miles off. I was bound, however, to interview
the gauger, and thereupon there entered
a stout man, with a very blossomy nose, dressed
in rusty black, who, at my invitation, seated
himself by the fire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;I have a requisition for twelve rank and
file to assist in capturing a still in the neighbourhood,
and here, sir, is the fee.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When do you propose to make the expedition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should leave this at eleven to-night, and
as no suspicion is aroused, we shall probably
capture the lot, still and all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I pushed the materials towards the gauger,
who required very little persuasion to avail himself
of the opportunity to brew a hot tumbler of punch.
On many former occasions I had by judicious
hospitality kept this functionary at bay until it
became too late, or the weather set in too bad, to
make a start, thus saving my men the harassing
duty we all disliked.</p>

<p>Now, however, the summons was imperative;
and I accordingly turned out my picquet, and
started with the revenue officer and his assistant
for a mountain some five or six miles distant from
my post.</p>

<p>The moon was shining brightly, and the sharp
frosty air of the night was most exhilarating.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
The light and springy step of my riflemen
suggested the idea of being on a poaching lark
rather than a solemn expedition for the vindication
of the law.</p>

<p>We had left the highway and ascended a few
hundred yards of the mountain-road, when the
gauger pointed out to me a light curling
white cloud, distant about a quarter of a mile,
rising as if from the ground. That was the
still.</p>

<p>Extending my small force, I formed a cordon
round the point, gradually closing in, till within
fifty yards of our object. This operation completed,
I left further proceedings to the gauger.</p>

<p>Suddenly my attention was attracted by
the melancholy wailing of a woman, and, on
investigation, I discovered an old hag who might
easily have been great-grandmother of all the
stills in the district.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Och-hone, och-hone! We&rsquo;ll all be kilt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
entirely. We&rsquo;ll all be kilt outright wid dem
soldiers. Och-hone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gauger now reappeared. His search,
both for men and machinery, had been fruitless.
At once the old woman opened upon him a
broadside of execrations such as are rarely heard
even from the lips of an infuriated Irish beldame,
strangely mixed with benedictions&mdash;the curses
for the gauger, the blessings for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the divil I pitch them gaugers. Long
life to y&rsquo;r honour. Bad cess to &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;d bail &rsquo;em
out of &mdash;&mdash; (purgatory?) ev they&rsquo;d wait. Och,
thin, God bless you and y&rsquo;r min! And thim
to say I had a still!&mdash;the blag-g-a-ards!&rdquo; All
the time never moving from her seat amongst
the ferns, whence she challenged the gaugers to
search the skibeen and welcome. &ldquo;Bad luck
to you and your ugly mate!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Finding the fun was over, I assembled my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
men and started on the homeward march; but
wishing to reward the ancient sibyl for her
blessing with a taste of tobacco, I halted the
party in the road for a minute, and hurried
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky not to have had your still
discovered,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh thin, good luck to your honour, and
it&rsquo;s you and your min saved it. May you live
till the longest tooth in your head makes a
walking-stick for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, my good woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure the boys seen the soldiers coming,
and they lighted a bit fire to blind &rsquo;em. The
gauger was never near our plant; and
for the worm, I was sitting on it all the
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I gave the old woman a blast for her pipe,
and drank a tot of the best potheen I ever
tasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>To revert to the subject of Irish coaching
which, as I have said before, was of the wildest
and most primitive description, before the great mail
contractor monopolised nearly every road in the
country, conveying both mails and passengers on
cars in a manner much better suited to the taste
and habits of the people.</p>

<p>What the original coaches lacked in neatness
they made up in pace. It was no uncommon
thing to see a team brought out to attach to a
coach, one blinded with a rubber, two with
twitches on their noses, and the fourth having
his leg tied up till the moment of departure. I
once started from Waterford under these circumstances,
and when all was ready, at the
moment of starting, the coachman having climbed
up, with his rope reins in hand, began shouting,
cheering, and rattling his feet against the footboard
to make them start. On this I reminded him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
that his whip was lying on the top of the luggage
behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bad luck to &rsquo;em! I wouldn&rsquo;t show &rsquo;em
that till they&rsquo;d ask for it,&rdquo; was the answer
&ldquo;Sure they&rsquo;d never lave home if they thought
I&rsquo;d take that along wid me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did start, with the vocal assistance of
half the spalpeens of the city, who followed us
barefooted for at least a mile&mdash;an Irish mile&mdash;out
of the town.</p>

<p>There is no country in the world where so
many clever horses are bred as in Ireland. I
say clever in the general acceptation of the word,
for an Irish horse is as great an adept at an
argument with his driver as he is in the falling
at once into the latter&rsquo;s views, and performing all
that he can expect from him with cheerfulness.</p>

<p>I have generally found in my experience that
a horse with a bad temper is a good stayer; while,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
on the other hand, an animal with a little temper,
easily got the better of, is a cur.</p>

<p>A horse in Ireland is never allowed to have
a bad temper; he only rises to tricks.</p>

<p>I was driving in Dublin some time since to
catch a boat, and the horse in the car, after
being very refractory, lay down. I was very
much incensed, and afraid of losing my passage,
when the driver quietly said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind him, sir; it&rsquo;s only <i>tricks</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since the reign of Bianconi the travelling
has very much improved. The long car, substituted
for the coach, is by no means an
uncomfortable carriage, and the weight being
kept so near the ground reduces the chances
of being upset to a minimum. The roads are
extremely good, and the scenery in some parts
indescribably beautiful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A revival of coaching was attempted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Dublin in the year 1879, but it did not attain
any great proportions. There was one coach,
however, with which I was intimately connected,
which ran from the Sherbourne Hotel,
Dublin, to the Vale of Avoca, and enjoyed a
fair share of success. It was a private venture,
was well horsed and appointed, changing four
times in fifty-four miles (down one day and up
another), and performing the journey in six
hours, including a liberal interval for lunch
each way.</p>

<p>This route embraces one of the most beautiful
parts of Ireland, through the county of Wicklow,
and the coach was consequently much encouraged
by tourists and foreigners.</p>

<p>When the days of Land League and low
rents (no rents) shall be buried in oblivion, and
the country restored to the condition which I
have described as its natural social aspect fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
years ago, I have no doubt that this and many
other roads out of Dublin will be as thickly
covered by amateur coaches as are the suburban
roads from London.</p>

<p class="afterdrop"><span class="uc"><span class="hide">T</span>he</span> intelligence of the horse, and his
judgment in hesitating to perform
feats which, if attempted, must result
in dangerous accidents, have afforded many proofs
of equine sagacity. On the other hand there
are bolters and kickers which indulge in these
vices apropos to nothing, and at times when a
bad accident must inevitably ensue.</p>

<p>The worst vices of the horse are comprised
in the <i>two</i> faults I have named. &ldquo;Bolting&rdquo;
means shying, running away, shifting suddenly
out of the road, or turning round short without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
notice. &ldquo;Kicking&rdquo; includes all the damage that
can be inflicted on man, carriage, harness, etc.,
by a living catapult tipped with iron.</p>

<p>There is a third defect&mdash;one of character&mdash;denominated
&ldquo;sulk.&rdquo; This is most tiresome and
trying, and, if not carefully and promptly dealt
with, may never be eradicated.</p>

<p>One thing is quite certain, that punishment
will not avail. Patience offers the only chance.
If the weather be fine and the driver in no particular
hurry, a daily paper is an excellent antidote
to this evil.</p>

<p>I knew an instance of a sulky horse being
checked when he attempted to move, and forced
to stand in one place almost in one position,
till his owner had read through <i>The Morning Post</i>
(advertisements and all), taking care to rustle the
paper occasionally in order to let the animal
know the cause of his detention. So effectual
was this remedy, that his master had only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
show him a newspaper to make him start like a
lamb.</p>

<div class="center">
<a href="images/i_225-large.jpg"><img src="images/i_225.jpg" width="600" height="284" alt="WILL HE JUMP?" /></a>
</div>

<p>If, as is sometimes the case, a horse be absolutely
determined not to move, and defies all
the usual methods of persuasion&mdash;holding up the
fore-leg, tying whip-cord tightly round his ear,
pushing at the wheel, etc.&mdash;but throws himself
down as if purposing to remain there, nothing
is left but to put a wisp of straw under him,
and set it alight. This, albeit it sounds cruel,
need not inflict the slightest injury&mdash;since the
horse at once obeys the instinct of alarm and
pain, and never forgets the experience; so that
straw, without the match, will always be sufficient
for the future.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ready obedience to his rider&rsquo;s wishes,
even when the horse&rsquo;s own judgment does not
confirm them, is another proof of the animal&rsquo;s
generous nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>We constantly hear of young men sowing
wild oats, but the <i>récolte</i> is seldom, if ever,
sufficiently successful to enable them to feed
their horses upon the produce. There is indeed
a <i>morne</i> silence in respect to the germinating
of this seed, which suggests the inference that
no crop can be expected till the grain has
perished and the granary is bare!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young friend of mine was driving his
team through some unfinished streets in one of
our favourite marine resorts. Not being much
practised in the art of &ldquo;pointing his leaders&rdquo;
in the direction which he intended to pursue,
he allowed them to continue a straight course
in a road which had no egress, but was blocked
at the end by a dwarf wall three feet in height.
A friend on the box beside him, finding he
had passed the turn by which he could have
got out, called to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hallo! pull up, man! You can&rsquo;t get out,
and you can&rsquo;t turn round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slacking his hand and fanning his wheelers,
the young Jehu quietly replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind; they can all <i>jump</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And they did all jump. No refusal. The
leaders got clear over without a scratch; the
wheelers, having broken the pole and splinter-bar,
got over the wall, but of course fell in a
confused heap, and were a good deal hurt.
The gentlemen on the box were shot to a
considerable distance into some &ldquo;ground to be
let for building purposes&rdquo; which lay convenient,
&ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; being also shot there!</p>

<p>Many of my readers may remember that
during the severe frost in the year that made
the fortune of Murphy&rsquo;s Almanac, Mr. Hunt,
the successful rival of Messrs. Day and Martin
in the manufacture of blacking, drove his team
and drag across the Serpentine; a foolhardy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
feat, seeing that the Serpentine was a treacherous
lake, and at that time of uncertain depth, both
of mud and water.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another instance, which illustrates forcibly
the courage and obedience of the horse, may
be in the reader&rsquo;s recollection.</p>

<p>A gentleman drove his curricle and pair
down Box Hill in Surrey, a descending declivity
upon which most horses would find it difficult
to stand, even without a carriage.</p>

<p>One more example I may adduce&mdash;which,
had I not been an eye-witness of it, I should
find it difficult to believe&mdash;illustrates the
courage of the horse and the folly of the
man.</p>

<p>A dealer was showing a horse, in harness,
to a customer who, after a short trial, finding
that the animal was likely to suit him, inquired
if he would jump. Being assured that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
would, the intending purchaser requested that
a hurdle might be set up.</p>

<p>Another gentleman, probably Irish, then
assumed the vacant seat in the tilbury, and to
the dealer&rsquo;s utter amazement the horse was
dashed at the obstacle.</p>

<p>There was no refusal; the obedient animal
bounded at the hurdle (a good stiff one), was
brought up by the wheels and shafts of the
gig, and tumbled backwards into the vehicle,
uninjured.</p>

<p>The results to the gentlemen were less
than their folly deserved&mdash;a broken collarbone
apiece&mdash;sprained wrists, and various
contusions, at least severe enough to confine
them to their beds for several days.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I now humbly submit these my Road Scrapings
to the reader, in the earnest hope that I may
have, in some measure, cleared the way for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
those who are disposed to avail themselves of
my suggestions, and enlivened it for those who
are not.</p>

<h2>SIX MONTHS IN MECCAH:</h2>

<p class="center">AN ACCOUNT OF<br />
<span class="large">The Mohammedan Pilgrimage to Meccah recently<br />
performed by an Englishman professing<br />
Mohammedanism.</span></p>

<p class="center xlarge smcap">By J. F. KEANE (Hajj Mohammed Amin).</p>

<p class="center large"><i>At all Libraries and Book-sellers&rsquo;.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">The ATHENÆUM says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those orthodox geographers who were startled by the American outsider&rsquo;s successful
walk into Africa will receive a hardly less severe shock on learning that the pilgrimage
to Meccah has been performed by a youngster of five-and-twenty, apparently a sailor by
profession, and with none of the special training enjoyed by his few predecessors....
The style of the work, if something eccentric and unconventional, is amusingly direct
and natural, and the occasional digressions are as original and characteristic as the rest.
His whole narrative, indeed, is a series of pictures.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">PUBLIC OPINION says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Keane has given an account of everything of interest that came under his
notice when in Meccah during the pilgrim season 1877-8.... The precarious position
of an unbeliever in any wholly Mohammedan town is well known, and Mr. Keane
appears to have run many risks; but he has managed to give us his narrative in a
modest style, free from all sorts of egotism; and any tale of Meccah that is within the
comprehension of the general public will always find auditors.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">The GRAPHIC says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It deserves to succeed; for though full of incidents which seem marvellous even to
Mr. Keane, it is rich in local colouring.... The book is well written, and deserves to
be widely read. Like Captain Burton, Mr. Keane believes in the gold and precious
stones of Arabia.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">The LITERARY WORLD says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;His description of this place [the Haram] and of the &lsquo;holy Kaabah&rsquo; is exceedingly
full and interesting, and, were it possible, we should like to have given an extract from
it. We give instead his description of Meccah.... The book is exceedingly readable,
and helps us to a better understanding of modern Mohammedanism.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">The DAILY CHRONICLE says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The simplicity of the narrative precludes any idea of book-making; and the scenes
described are so fresh that they will awaken considerable interest, and lead the readers
to look anxiously for the fresh volume of adventure half promised by the author.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">JOHN BULL says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very entertaining book.... We have little but praise to give to his spirited
narrative. He is never dull, and has given us a most graphic picture of his personal
experiences when making the pilgrimage to Meccah.... His account of Meccah
itself, and of the various pilgrims from different countries who there congregate, is full
of interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">The GLOBE says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The book is full of interest.... The author must have mixed freely with the
lower classes of Asiatics, either in Arabia or elsewhere, to be able to give such faithful
descriptions of what passes among them when by themselves.... Eminently readable.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">The SUNDAY TIMES says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He tells his own story, and gives his own experiences, with graphic power. The
book is full of interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">VANITY FAIR says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Keane&rsquo;s account of the pilgrimage to Meccah, in the disguise of a Mohammedan,
is both interesting and amusing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">MANCHESTER POST says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The book is a remarkable one&mdash;unpretentious, yet absorbing, and crammed full of
incidents which have never before been narrated.&rdquo;</p>
